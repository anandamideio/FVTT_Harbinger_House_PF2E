# intro

## Introduction

> A lot of barmy things happen in the Cage. That's just the nature of a place that's connected to everywhere and serves as a waystation for planewalkers from every corner of the multiverse.
>
> Still, a cutter knows that he can count on a certain amount of stability, even in a place like Sigil. Take the dabus, for instance. They repair what's broken, cut back the evergrowing razorvine, and otherwise serve as cryptic workers weaving their way through the streets of the city. 'Course, some berks learn there's more to the dabus when they threaten Sigil's high-up, the Lady of Pain. Then the dabus arrive as the Lady's agents, swift to punish. Either way, there's a degree of comfort in their ever-present activities.
>
> But what if something bad were to happen — something so foul and evil that even the dabus came to know fear? That's when cutters and bloods should pack up and head out, 'cause something that threatens the Lady and makes even the dabus nervous must be sodding awful — and everybody knows there's still plenty of room in the dead-book for the careless, the foolish, and the brave.

### The Tale of Harbinger House

> "It shelters those who are still developing," **Factol Ambar** of the Godsmen explained to the new custodian as they walked along one of Sigil's cobbled streets. The woman beside him was **Bereth**, chosen from among the best the faction had to offer for the skills and compassion she possessed. "These are the forerunners of the next generation of powers," he continued, "a small group of individuals who have been mistaken for barmies by the rest of Sigil. We, however, know better."
>
> They walked in silence for a time, neither one speaking as they traveled from the Foundry toward the oldest section of the Lower Ward. The buildings in this area pressed in upon them, and the narrow streets became less crowded with every new turn they made. Bereth felt as though sinister eyes were watching her, but the factol was calm, and she didn't want to appear nervous or afraid while in his presence. She followed him onto an ancient street, set off by a spiky wall of stone and razorvine. It was a dead-end, she knew, and at its deepest point their destination waited.
>
> "Sometimes the pressures of evolving to the next level take a toll on the powers-to-be," the factol said as he led her toward the structure at the end of the block. "Sometimes we must care for these ascenders, keep them well until the process reaches its conclusion. And we do that here, in **Harbinger House**."
>
> Bereth let loose the breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding when the House came into view. It was always "the House," with a capital "H" and a tone of wonder. It was huge, more like a mansion than a home, but its architecture was as mad as the inhabitants sheltered within its tilted walls. With its haphazard towers, leaning sides, and jumble of doors, windows, and staircases, it was a structure right out of a Xaositect's dreams — or a Guvner's nightmares. There didn't seem to be a single right angle in sight. Instead, the House was built of obtuse and acute angles that made some walls lean crazily forward while others pulled in upon themselves. It was unnerving, but Bereth could also feel the power emanating from the place.
>
> "It's as old as the Cage itself, and as enigmatic," Factol Ambar noted, standing beside Bereth in the shadow of the House. Its dark windows stared down at them with silent regard, but its many doors remained closed. Bereth tried to follow the course of an exterior staircase with her eyes, but it hurt to look at the House too long or too hard. "Inside you will see majesty and mystery, and as you help the powers-to-be recognize themselves and climb to the next stage of existence, you also will ascend."
>
> Bereth remembered the other thing the Godsmen always said about Harbinger House.
>
> "Within its twisted halls and random chambers waits the ultimate answer to the tests of the multiverse. Find that answer, and the Final Ascension will be at hand."
>
> However, before either factol or custodian could approach the House's main entrance, the front door swung open and a disheveled Godsman stumbled out. "Factol Ambar," the Godsman called, "it's terrible! Terrible! Two of our charges — they've slipped the blinds, given us the laugh!"
> 
> "Who, man? Tell me!" Factol Ambar demanded. Bereth's blood turned cold.
>
> "Trolan, Factol Ambar," the Godsman stammered, "and Sougad. By the Source of All, **Sougad Lawshredder** has escaped!"
>
> Lawshredder — the name Bereth had imagined. Fear exploded within her like the fires of Dis, filling her with dread instead of heat. She looked to her factol for comfort but found in his face only terror. Above them, the House seemed to lean closer, like a vulture peering down to see if its meal had stopped twitching. The Final Ascension had never felt as unattainable as it did at that moment. Or as dangerous.

### Background

This section gives a Dungeon Master (DM) enough information to grasp what's really going on in the adventure. It includes an overview of Harbinger House; what's already happened to bring the story to the point at which the adventure begins; the dark of the planarity and the focrux, mysterious items of great power; and the roles played by the barmies Sougad and Trolan in the unfolding plot.

#### The House

Harbinger House sits on a quiet, dead-end street in the Lower Ward (though some claim it's in The Lady's Ward), towering above the neighboring buildings. Its multiple levels rise in all directions, piled haphazardly atop each other like blocks placed by a demented child. Walls tilt at insane angles, and dark windows reflect the lantern light of the nearby hovels. Staircases climb and descend around the House like latticework adornments. Some reach toward entryways, others lead nowhere. Finally, and perhaps most important, are the doors. Doors of all sizes and descriptions fill the walls of Harbinger House, inside and out — ornate doors, plain doors, elaborate open arches, simple sealed portals, doors of wood and stone and brass, and more. Doors are everywhere, and they're almost all locked tight.

Harbinger House is a place of power, a nexus of energy, almost like a smaller version of Sigil itself. Its doors, like the portals of the Cage, open into the multiverse — if a berk has the proper key. But the key to the doors of Harbinger House is harder to come by than the keys that open the Cage. And there's good reason for that. The House shelters some of Sigil's most prominent barmies, so the caretakers take great pains to protect their secrets.

Who are the caretakers? The **Believers of the Source** (also called the Godsmen) have taken it upon themselves to administer to both the House and its inhabitants. They believe that the House and the barmies they've selected to shelter are important to the Final Ascension. Remember, belief has power in the planes, so the conviction of the faction shouldn't be taken lightly. As the Godsmen see it, the residents of the House are powers-in-the-making, cutters and bloods almost ready to take the next step up the staircase of existence. The Godsmen have taken it upon themselves to care for them until the process finishes. Imagine the favors the faction might command when one of their charges reaches the full state of powerhood!

As far as anyone knows, such an event hasn't happened — yet. But all of the barmies residing in the House do have a limited number of spell-like abilities that mark them — in the Godsmen's minds, anyway — as powers-in-the-making.

Harbinger House itself is described in detail in Chapter III. The House is much larger on the inside than it appears to be from the outside; see the DM's screen for a partial map of the interior. It's a house of secrets, a place of mysteries hidden behind dark windows, a place as dangerous as it is alluring.

#### What Has Gone Before

**Nari**, a cunning succubus from the Abyss, has long sought to rise above her lesser station and gain more influence in tanar'ri society. But as she can't hope to match the greater tanar'ri in their endless games of war and destruction, she's tried to find an edge, something that'll give her the power to compete with even the true tanar'ri. She believes such an edge — if one exists at all — can be found in Sigil, the City of Doors.

Nari arrived in the Cage some weeks ago. Deciding her purpose would be better served if her true nature was kept hidden, she took the form of a beautiful human female and began making the rounds of taverns, inns, and guild halls, seeking something to aid her ambitions. It didn't take long for the rumors about Harbinger House to reach her. The idea of a nexus of planar energy that's a miniature version of Sigil was a rumor too good to leave unexplored. She used all the skills and talents at her disposal to hook up with the custodian of the House, a Godsman named **Old Favur**.

After a few dalliances with the Godsman, Nari learned enough of Harbinger House's secrets to know she wanted to possess it. During their times together, Favur gladly provided her with information about the House and the people it sheltered. The succubus was particularly interested in two of the barmies: Sougad Lawshredder and **Trolan of Ecstasy** (now called simply **Trolan the Mad**).

A decade ago, Sougad carved a bloody path through the Cage, murdering members of lawful factions in a ritualistic fashion. Before the dabus or the Harmonium could bring him down, the Godsmen captured Sougad and made a place for him in Harbinger House. The faction believed Sougad's innate abilities marked him as someone who'd already transcended mere mortality, and that the murders were part of an elaborate rite to bring him to full powerhood.

Trolan, too, came to Sigil with a definite goal in mind: to win the love of the Lady of Pain. He was devoted to her, trying in vain to get her attention while others preferred to avoid even her passing shadow. The dabus, enigmatic servants of the Lady that they are, brought Trolan to Harbinger House and left him in the care of the Godsmen. Why he wasn't flayed, quartered, or otherwise put in the dead-book is unknown, but it was the very fact that Trolan had expressed his adoration of the Lady and remained alive that earned him a place in Harbinger House.

Nari wants to gain possession of the House by changing the hearts and minds of its inhabitants over to her way of thinking. She's heard whispers about towns on the Outlands that slid into other planes once the attitudes of the residents shifted from neutrality to law or chaos, and she believes she can do the same thing with Harbinger House. She figures that once the place slides into the Abyss, it won't take long for her to unlock its secrets.

(What Nari doesn't know is that the House won't slide out of Sigil. Fact is, none of the Cage can be cast off except by the power of the Lady of Pain. But the PCs probably don't know that either, so they'll act to stop Nari's scheme. After all, better safe than sorry.)

The plan was simple: Trolan would occupy the Lady while Nari seduced Harbinger House into her corner. Sougad, however, offered Nari something more. "No matter what you may think, Mistress of Chaos," Sougad told her from behind the locked door of his prison, "the Godsmen are right. There is a way to step up the ladder of existence, to ascend from mortal to immortal. I've already taken the first steps out of the realm of humanity and into the plane of power. It has nothing to do with the tests the Godsmen go on and on about. It has to do with this place — with Harbinger House."

To further his own ends, Sougad told Nari his plan for becoming a power. He left out some details, but he provided enough so she saw the dark of it. "Since I've been here, I've learned that you need two things to vitalize the ritual," Sougad confided. "The planarity and the focrux control the House, and the House opens the conduits of spiritual energy needed to achieve godhood. That was the mistake I made the first time. I had the ritual, but I didn't have the energy to power it."

Like most planars, Nari knew that powers were barred from entering Sigil — the Lady of Pain somehow prevented it. But what if a power were created in Sigil? Could even the Lady stop such a transformation?

Nari charmed Old Favur, the custodian, into telling her about the items Sougad had mentioned. "The planarity is a unique artifact that never leaves Factol Ambar's possession," Old Favur explained one night as the candle beside his bed burned low. "Its shape constantly changes, and to look at it is to see the energy of the multiverse itself. What does it do? Why, it opens the doors, of course. All the doors of Harbinger House."

As for the focrux, Favur called it the heart of Harbinger House. "It looks like a larger version of the planarity," he said, "but its connection to the energy of the multiverse is much more powerful. If the planarity is the key, then the focrux is the floodgate waiting to be opened. And we will open it, when the Final Ascension is at hand."

#### The Planarity and the Focrux

At rest, the **planarity** appears to be a nondescript sphere of deep-blue stone, perfectly round and smooth, that fits in the palm of a hand. However, when it comes within 50 feet of a planar portal, the planarity reacts with excitement. It changes shape, and a storm of energy rises up from its depths to play along the inner surface of the stone. Spiky protrusions emerge from the smooth surface, jutting as much as three inches before plunging back into the stone. These protrusions extend and retract faster and faster as the planarity gets closer to a portal. At the same time, the inner storm intensifies into a raging dance of color.

The planarity is a gate key, but not in the normal sense. Unlike other gate keys, which are linked to specific planar doors, the planarity has the power to open any portal in Harbinger House. In addition, it's the only key that unlocks the sealed doors there (both mundane and planar). The Godsmen's factol keeps the planarity in his possession at all times, sure that it'll play an important, if not pivotal, role in the Final Ascension.

Anyone who holds the planarity can use it — that is, anyone who knows the command word. A body's just got to place the item in his open palm, approach any planar portal, and utter the right word. The planarity rises and floats a few inches above the palm, and the portal opens. The device doesn't work if it's in a pocket or pack, so accidental trips aren't possible.

What's more, the planarity constantly records and stores images and sounds from activities in its immediate area. This feature was intended as a means to keep track of which portals were opened, and when. Only the factol of the Godsmen can call forth the full history of stored images, which "replay," life size, in plain sight. However, if the PCs gain possession of the planarity, they can summon images of the previous few hours — an ability that might prove important at the end of the adventure.

The **focrux** is a bigger version of the planarity — about 15 feet in diameter. It stays inside Harbinger House at all times, as the Godsmen believe it to be the spiritual core of the House, a conduit for planar energies. All strange properties of the House — such as the fact that it's bigger on the inside than it appears on the outside — are powered by the focrux. It also causes the exterior of the House to reflect magic, preventing berks from harming the place or sneaking inside. As with the planarity, the Godsmen are certain that the focrux will prove to be critical to the Final Ascension.

One property of the focrux that plays an important role in the adventure is its ability to block all of Harbinger House from scrying. No one — not even the Lady of Pain — can peer inside while the focrux is operational. Fact is, the focrux accounts for the uneasiness of the Lady (and, through her, the dabus), as she can't pinpoint the berk who dares to tamper with portals and powers in the heart of Sigil.

#### Sougad and Trolan

Sougad agreed to help Nari in exchange for his freedom. She charged him to resume his murder spree, thus keeping the lawful factions too busy to notice her actions. Sougad, however, has his own agenda. He wants to finish his ascent to powerhood by completing his ritual and using the planarity and the focrux once Nari's mastered the items.

Trolan, meanwhile, is to occupy the attention of the Lady of Pain and her servants. By approaching Trolan in the guise of the Lady herself, Nari has turned the barmy into a prophet. In preaching his devotion to the Lady of Pain, Trolan's natural charisma will convert others to his cause, and, before long, his cult of Lady devotees (called **Those Who Court the Lady**) will descend on the Cage to break the Lady's cardinal rule: no direct worship of Sigil's high-up. The chaos and mayhem will be exquisite!

Unfortunately for Nari, Old Favur retired before her plan could be set in motion. A new custodian, Bereth, was selected to oversee Harbinger House and its guests, an unforeseen event that forced the succubus to release Sougad and Trolan earlier than she'd planned.

### Summary of the Adventure

The player characters (PCs) begin Harbinger House in Sigil, engaged in some between-adventure activity. They may be relaxing and enjoying the wonders of the City of Doors, looking for work, or browsing the Cage's shops in search of bargains and rare planar items. The adventure is designed so the DM can involve the PCs in the story from almost anywhere in the Cage.

In **Chapter I**, the PCs witness a number of strange occurrences plaguing Sigil. They see dabus behaving in odd ways, meet members of a cult called Those Who Court the Lady, and learn the facts and rumors surrounding a series of gruesome murders. This last chain of events — the slayings of lawful sods throughout the Lower Ward and The Lady's Ward — is the main focus and challenge of this chapter. The PCs must find and try to stop the killer, Sougad Lawshredder, even if they don't yet realize the dark of his madness.

In **Chapter II**, the PCs leave the Cage and head to the Outlands, either following Sougad after he escaped or seeking the leader of the Lady-worshiping cult. In the gate-town of Ecstasy, the PCs learn a bit more about Trolan and discover that Sougad is still killing lawful sods in a ritualistic fashion. A dramatic confrontation with Sougad leads the PCs to believe — wrongly — that the barmy's been put in the dead-book once and for all. What's more, the PCs find that Trolan's rounding up more cultists in the gate-town of Curst and presumably head there to stop him.

Once in Curst, the party finds not one barmy who's escaped from Harbinger House, but two — Trolan and **Pastor Browen**. Trolan and members of his cult have become trapped in the Walled City, though a large contingent of Those Who Court the Lady is already on its way to the Cage. Pastor Browen, on the other hand, has been sent by Nari to ambush the PCs, in case their meddling might actually disturb her plans. With the help of the Revolutionary League and the town's Wall Watch, Browen plans to stop the PCs when they come to find Trolan.

In **Chapter III**, the PCs return to Sigil to explore Harbinger House, which seems to hold the key to the mysteries of the murders, the cult, and the dabus. The House has been darkly changed as a result of being under Nari's control; the heroes must work their way through its maddening rooms and dangerous barmies to find the new master of the House before she tries to ascend to the next level of existence. Though the PCs don't know it, Sougad still lives, and he's getting ready to make an ascension himself.

### Preparing for Play

The Dungeon Master must have copies of the AD&D Player's Handbook (PH), Dungeon Master Guide (DMG), and the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set to properly run Harbinger House. Copies of the Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix, A Player's Primer to the Outlands, and In the Cage: A Guide to Sigil are also useful but not necessary to play this adventure.

Harbinger House is designed for a party of four to six player characters of 4th to 7th level. The group shouldn't be new to Sigil or the planes; in other words, don't use this adventure as an introduction to the setting. It works best as part of an existing Planescape Campaign.

It's important to keep in mind that a Planescape adventure is more about ideas than monster-bashing. The DM is encouraged to award experience points based on completing story goals (see Chapter 8 of the DMG). The conclusion of this adventure addresses story-based awards for Harbinger House.

Italicized text printed in amber is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased to the players. Information meant only for the DM is set off with amber diamonds (◆). Furthermore, special **DM Notes** are scattered throughout the adventure to reveal important information and pass on role-playing advice. DMs will also find sections labeled **The Real Chant** and **Slipping the Blinds** that respectively clarify plot points and give directions for dealing with possible problems.

The gatefold screen that accompanies the adventure provides both DM and player maps. The outside features two full-color maps of sections of Sigil for the players to use as their characters explore the streets and buildings of the Cage. The inside features the same maps of Sigil, customized for the DM — these versions contain numbers that mark the important sites likely to be visited by players. Note that these maps are close-ups of Sigil and contain some details and street names not shown on the overall map in In the Cage: A Guide to Sigil. (Because the size of Sigil can change at the whim of the Lady of Pain, the maps of the city blocks have no scales to indicate exact distances.) The inside of the screen also contains a partial map of the gate-town of Ecstasy, and a map of the rooms in Harbinger House that the PCs must explore.

In Harbinger House, the PCs run into several different types of tanar'ri. Most tanar'ri have a gate ability that lets them summon other fiends; however, gate abilities aren't listed in the tanar'ri statistics provided in this adventure. The only place the PCs'll run into tanar'ri is in Sigil, and the Cage can't be entered by a gate spell.

Finally, the DM is encouraged to read the entire adventure before attempting to run it.

### Factions in This Adventure

Factions always play some part in a Planescape adventure, as most PCs belong to one philosophical fraternity or another. Because so much of this adventure revolves around Harbinger House, the Believers of the Source have a vested interest in the unfolding events. Their general reaction to the events of the story — along with that of the other factions — is outlined below.

#### The Athar

The Athar don't believe the chant about Harbinger House for a minute. A place full of barmy powers-in-the-making? Ha! A place full of barmy liars is more like it! The mysteries presented in the adventure attract the attention of the Lost, however. As the Defiers love to discover the secret behind everything and long to look upon the face of the unknowable, mysteries concerning the Lady of Pain, the dabus, and Sigil itself certainly spark the Athar's interest. 'Course, the faction's most concerned about the murder spree. Two lawful members of the Athar were victims of the murderer, and **Factol Terrance** calls for a quick solution.

#### Believers of the Source

The Believers of the Source have a natural connection to the events in this adventure. Harbinger House is a holding of the Godsmen, staffed by Godsmen, and supported by Godsmen funds. A problem that threatens the House and the Cage around it definitely concerns the faction.

The Believers of the Source know that something of great importance is occurring in the shadow of Harbinger House. Faction officials could hire the PCs to look into matters, capture the escaped barmies (quietly and without fuss, of course), or recover the planarity after it's stolen from Factol Ambar in Chapter I. However, the Godsmen try their best not to have the faction publicly connected to the bad events plaguing Sigil. The faction wants to end Sougad's threat quickly, without letting too much information leak out. As for Trolan, if the Godsmen can't contain him, they'll do their best to claim he was never under their care. Other factions — especially those that consider the Godsmen to be their enemies, like the Bleak Cabal and the Dustmen — would love to get their hands on proof that the Godsmen messed up.

#### The Bleak Cabal

The Bleak Cabal is especially interested in finding information that paints the Believers of the Source in a poor light. While blame for all of the trouble that revolves around Harbinger House falls on Nari's shoulders, a Bleaker could make a healthy case to at least discredit the Godsmen and gain favor in his own faction.

#### The Doomguard

The Doomguard are quite interested in finding the murderer and putting a stop to the bloodshed. After all, lawful members of this faction are as likely to be targeted by Sougad as other lawfuls. If a member of the PC group belongs to the faction, he or she might be approached by the faction leaders to look into the ongoing murders before a Doomguard cutter ends up in the dead-book.

#### The Dustmen

The law-killer obviously has no respect or appreciation for Death, though he is desperately trying to impress it with his bloody antics. All Sougad's accomplishing is to force his victims to go through the whole process again — and that's something no Dustman-in-good-standing can tolerate. Trolan, on the other hand, at least shows style and loving devotion in his mad rush toward Death's warm embrace.

The faction leadership watches to make sure the murders don't spread to the Hive or otherwise impinge on the Dustmen's areas of interest, and they make an effort to collect the victims for the Mortuary, but they otherwise stay out of the proceedings.

#### The Fated

The Fated see the actions of both Sougad and Trolan as signs of weakness and cowardice: Both seek to gain respect of a sort without properly earning it. What's more, the utter evil of Nari's scheme should perturb all but the most evil of the Fated.

The faction leadership keeps a close eye on the murders of the members of the other factions, but refuses to get involved in matters that don't directly concern the Fated. The factol, **Duke Rowan Darkwood**, won't order his members to act unless a reward of some sort is involved. Anything less would be considered charity, and the Fated don't perform acts of charity for any reason.

#### The Fraternity of Order

The breakdown of law definitely disturbs the Fraternity of Order. Flagrant criminal acts, total disregard for the law, wanton acts of violence — it's enough to make a Guvner go barmy! Beyond the obviously evil acts of Sougad and the leatherheaded actions of Trolan, the thought of the dabus losing their ordered approach to city maintenance causes great distress in the hearts and minds of Guvners everywhere.

While only one member of this faction winds up in the dead-book by the start of the adventure, the faction believes itself to be the murderer's primary target. Because of this, all other incidental events take a back seat as far as **Factol Hashkar** is concerned. He may even hire the PCs to bring the murderer to justice; after all, order must be reestablished before all of Sigil collapses into chaos!

#### The Free League

As a group, the Free League won't get involved; however, any PCs who are members of this faction might choose to throw in with whichever side seems to offer the best rewards.

#### The Harmonium

Harmonium cutters'll seek to arrest the criminal responsible for the murders; Sougad's actions demand an appropriate response. Once the first victim is discovered, **Factol Sarin** mobilizes his Hardheads and assigns his best investigator, **Narcovi**, to solve the case (especially since one of the victims was a member of the Harmonium). Sarin believes that the murders are the work of a rival faction, probably the Xaositects or the Revolutionary League. As the factol's representative in this matter, Narcovi may enlist the PCs' help to catch the perpetrator — or pursue them as suspects as the murders continue.

#### The Mercykillers

The Mercykillers are charged with protecting justice, and the events surrounding Harbinger House threaten justice in all its forms. **Factol Nilesia** is furious that members of allied factions have been showing up in the dead-book, and the Mercykillers descend on the streets of Sigil like a penetrating mist. They'll never find Sougad, but that doesn't mean they can't cause trouble for the PCs. They can interfere with the PCs' own investigation, chase after them as suspects, or even go out of their way to ask the PCs for help.

#### The Revolutionary League

Anarchist cutters see Trolan as a heroic symbol. He's slapping the faces of law, order, and sanity, going so far as to risk death to change the rules and do things his own way. As for Sougad, some Anarchists see him as the harbinger of the True Revolution and revel in the chaos and fear he's inspired. Other members of the faction see him as a wild card who could doom the Revolution before it has a chance to move into full swing. The law-killer's methods are too extreme, they say, and the League has to keep itself dark from the factions that would destroy it.

Harbinger House, however, appears to be nothing more than a glorified indoctrination camp. A true victory for the Revolution would be to discover what's happening in the House, and then set the prisoners free.

#### The Sign of One

A small but vocal portion of the Sign of One faction believes that the person responsible for imagining the multiverse is doing it from somewhere in the depths of Harbinger House. PC Signers have at least heard the theory, even if they don't believe it. Still, events happening around the House are worth looking into, just in case there's something to the chant.

#### The Society of Sensation

Sensates find the events surrounding Harbinger House to their liking. There are secrets to be learned in each experience, and nothing should be allowed to just pass by. Perhaps a Sensate wants to hear the words of Trolan, letting his own heart sail toward the enigmatic Lady of Pain. Or maybe he wants to feel the sharp touch of her shadow before the blades strike. Of course, death is an experience to be saved for the very end, and no Sensate wants that end to be in the near future.

**Factol Montgomery** won't order anyone from the faction to investigate the murders or the actions of the cult. All Sensates are free to explore the fires of their senses, but only in an unofficial capacity.

#### The Transcendent Order

The Transcendent Order seeks a harmony of mind and body that makes quick action a virtue. With each new problem or obstacle thrown in their path, Ciphers not only attempt to make fast decisions and quick responses, they also try to make the right ones.

**Factol Rhys** won't command the Ciphers to become directly involved in the events surrounding Harbinger House. She has no interest in letting her faction interfere in the internal politics of the Lower Ward and The Lady's Ward. The right action, in this case, is no action — it'll keep her and hers alive. 'Course, once the murderer moves on to

Once Trolan of Ecstasy, now **Trolan the Mad** (and later Trolan the Beloved), the bard has one great love in his life. Unfortunately, it's a love that could kill him: Trolan is devoted to the **Lady of Pain**. As any berk can tell you, no one worships **Sigil's** high-up in any manner. To do so brings down her wrath and sends the offending sod off to his final reward. Such warnings never deterred Trolan, though. He first heard about the Lady as a young bard in the gate-town of Ecstasy. What other berks spoke of in careful whispers, Trolan shouted in the light of day. He composed songs to the Lady, wrote sonnets, and took every story he could find and turned them into epic poems.

Trolan traveled to the Cage six years ago and soon found a tavern to perform in. Much to the owner's dismay, the young tiefling sang a song of love to the Lady of Pain—going so far as to name her not once, but nine times before the song was done. The crowd fled in terror and the tavern owner threw the bard into the street, fully expecting the Lady's shadow to swallow Trolan whole. Nothing happened, however, and Trolan walked off into the night.

It wasn't long before no inn or drinking hall would let Trolan within 50 feet of the door, let alone inside to perform. The **Harmonium** wouldn't let him sing the Lady's praises in the streets, and the **Mercykillers** were preparing to deal out their own form of punishment when the dabus surrounded the bard and took him away. What the factions don't know is that the dabus took him to **Harbinger House** and placed him in the **Godsmen's** care. Trolan's got a natural healing ability that mends his body; the dabus hoped the faction could mend the tiefling's mind. The Godsmen, of course, saw Trolan as a power-to-be, a barmy worthy of study and care.

To gain Trolan's help, **Nari**—who's taken command of the House—appeared to him in the guise of the Lady of Pain. She claimed to love him as much as he loved her, and asked him to spread the word: The Lady wanted to be loved and worshiped by the masses. It was up to Trolan to show them how by forming the cult called **Those Who Court the Lady**. 'Course, Trolan doesn't realize he's just a pawn in Nari's game. By diverting the attention of the real Lady of Pain, the cult should keep her from messing up Nari's plans.

## Crimjak the Marquis Cambion

**Str** 19, **Dex** 16, **Con** 17, **Int** 18, **Wis** 14, **Cha** 16

**THAC0** 15; **#AT** 2; **Dmg** 1d8+3 (long sword +3); **AC** 0 (Dex bonus); **HD** 6; **hp** 42; **MV** 15; **SA** Strength bonus (+3 to attack rolls, +7 to damage rolls); wizard spells (4 1st-level, 2 2nd-level, 2 3rd-level); **SD** never surprised; immune to electricity, nonmagical fire, and poison; half damage from cold, magical fire, and gas; **MR** 30%; **SZ** M (7 feet tall); **AL** CE; **ML** elite (13); **XP** 6,000.

**Spell-like abilities** (usable at will, once per round, unless otherwise indicated): *darkness 15' radius*, *infravision*, *levitate* (seven times per day), *polymorph self* (three times per day), and *teleport without error*.

After learning of Harbinger House, Nari contacted an old friend back in the **Abyss**—Crimjak, for whom she'd lured many mortals to that chaotic evil plane. She told Crimjak that the time had come for him to repay a bit of his debt. Nari claimed he'd be rewarded many times over for helping her, as her goal was to push the House—a place full of magical planar energy—into the Abyss. 'Course, she left out the part about her becoming a new power, figuring that Crimjak didn't need to know everything.

## Narcovi

**Female dwarf planar, 9th-level fighter, Harmonium**

**Str** 14, **Dex** 12, **Con** 12, **Int** 17, **Wis** 14, **Cha** 10

**THAC0** 12; **#AT** 3/2; **Dmg** 1d8+3 (long sword +3); **AC** 0 (field plate +2); **hp** 54; **MV** 6; **SZ** M (4 feet tall); **AL** LG; **ML** champion (16); **XP** 2,000.

This feisty cutter's the chief investigator assigned by the Harmonium to look into the recent string of murders in the Cage. A tough, no-nonsense Hardhead, **Narcovi** loves to get the really difficult cases. She sees them as challenges befitting her investigative skills, and when a case comes her way, she throws everything she has into finding the solution. For this particular case, Narcovi's got eight Hardhead agents backing her up, and a dozen more searching the wards for clues, witnesses, and weird rumors that might lead her to the killer.

**Harbinger House** can begin in any number of ways, depending on where the PCs finished up their last adventure. A few sample "Quick Starts" are presented below: with modifications, one should work as an opening for any particular group of PCs. "Return Trip" starts the moment the PCs return to the Cage from somewhere else (the recommended opening for the adventure); "Relaxing in the Cage" opens with the PCs enjoying a quiet dinner at an inn; and "Shopping Day" begins as the PCs search for bargains in one of Sigil's more unusual shops. After the DM selects one of the opening scenes, the remaining two should be used as encounters later in this chapter.

Chapter 1 follows a number of paths that take the PCs throughout the **Lower Ward** and **The Lady's Ward**. A series of grisly murders has the wards up in arms when the adventure starts. As the PCs get drawn into the plot, they also discover other strange happenings in the Cage. The dabus, for example, are acting in peculiar fashion: cleaning areas that aren't dirty, fixing things that aren't broken, and generally behaving nervously. What's more, a new cult has recently appeared in the Cage, one with an unusual object of affection: the Lady of Pain. No one knows why the Lady hasn't put them all in the dead-book already, but that doesn't stop folks from speculating (some even suggest her lack of a brutal response means she approves of the worship).

This chapter ends with a confrontation with **Sougad**, the barmy committing the murders. The PCs and Sougad battle over the rooftops of Sigil, finally winding up across from a small park where a group of Those Who Court the Lady prepare to offer homage to Sigil's high-up. The PCs, locked in battle with Sougad, catch glimpses of the moving ceremony of love and devotion. But Sougad escapes through a portal before he can be defeated, and at that moment the PCs witness the arrival of the Lady of Pain. Her shadow passes over the park, and every barmy it touches receives bloody wounds from the outline of her bladed countenance.

---

## Quick Start I: Return Trip

This scene begins the adventure just as the PCs return to Sigil from a trip across the planes. They emerge from a portal to discover that things aren't exactly the way they remember them. For this quick start to be effective, the PCs must return through a portal in the Lower Ward or The Lady's Ward. Preferably, the portal should be near Harbinger House, as that's the area where the strange activities of the dabus are most concentrated. Read:

> You step through the glowing portal to stand in the shadows of a crowded Sigil street. Berks of all descriptions move past you, each in a hurry to get to wherever he or she is going. And in Sigil, they can be going, quite literally, anywhere.
>
> Across the cobbled street you notice a group of four dabus, servants of the Lady of Pain. They're busy painting the side of a two-story building. The dabus work silently, dipping brushes in buckets of blue paint and applying it with broad, sweeping strokes. Then you notice something else. The building that the dabus are painting has already been painted. A shiny, fresh coat of yellow gleams brightly beneath the growing blue, though the dabus continue their work as if the wall hadn't been painted in more than a century.

While less dramatic in some ways than the other quick starts, the hints provided here could prove even scarier in the long run. What could cause the usually unflappable dabus to behave so strangely? And what does such behavior bode for the future?

The PCs should also notice that other passersby are totally ignoring the dabus, acting as though the Lady's servants perform senseless work everyday. If the PCs ask any of the passersby about the dabus, a bariaur comments, "They've been working on that wall for almost a week now. It's been blue, red, green, yellow, and now blue again. I can't wait to see what color they use next." No matter how many people the PCs ask, they receive the same answer: There's nothing unusual going on. However, any PCs who make a successful Wisdom check while questioning the crowd notice that the passersby seem a bit nervous. They're hiding it well, but there's a tension in their voices, their postures, and the way their eyes move back and forth. Any PC who makes the check by more than 5 realizes just what the tension is—fear.

If the PCs try to question the dabus, they get nowhere. The dabus routinely ignore the presence of others, and at this point in the adventure the PCs are no exception. No matter how hard the PCs try, they can't get the dabus to notice them. If they stand in the way, the dabus step around them. If they place themselves in front of the wall, the dabus paint over them as though they were just another part of the scenery. Eventually, the PCs should take the hint and move on.

If the PCs are foolish enough to attack the dabus, they do get a response: The dabus descend upon them with the wrath and fury normally reserved for enemies of Sigil and the Lady of Pain. Once one of the PCs falls, the dabus cease their attack—if the remaining PCs do likewise. Otherwise, it might be time to roll up new characters, because enough dabus can be summoned to put down even the most powerful PC party.

**The Real Chant:** The strange behavior exhibited by the dabus is a symptom of the illness affecting the Cage. Until Nari's threat is ended and Trolan has been returned to Harbinger House, the dabus continue to reflect the unexplained nervousness of the Lady of Pain. While the Lady knows that something's wrong in the city, she can't locate the trouble due to the blocking effects of the foerux. However, she senses the energy gathering in Sigil. Sougad's ritual, Nari's manipulations, even Trolan's exploits—all of these events are leading to the birth of a new power. Powers are usually sealed off from Sigil, but what happens if one is created in the Cage? The Lady doesn't know the specifics, but she is concerned, and, as a result, the dabus are almost frightened.

**DM Note:** After this initial scene, the PCs should be introduced to news of the murders. One of the follow-up scenes described later in this chapter (or even "Quick Start II" or "Quick Start III") can be used to draw the PCs deeper into the story. If the DM uses a different opening for the adventure, the dabus' strange paint job can still be played out later, as the PCs explore the Cage.

**Dabus (4 or var):** THAC0 15; #AT 1; Dmg 1d8 or by weapon; AC 7; HD 6; hp 26 each; MV 12; SD immune to spells that affect the surface beneath them or the air around them; SZ M (6 feet tall); Int very (12); AL N; ML steady (12); XP 420.

## Quick Start II: Relaxing in the Cage

Another possible beginning for this adventure centers around a relaxing dinner at the PCs' favorite inn or tavern. The details of the location are left to the DM so that the scene can be placed in an existing establishment in the campaign. The scene shouldn't take place too long after the PCs return to Sigil upon completing a previous adventure. As their food arrives and their mugs are refilled, an intriguing conversation at the next table turns to matters that might interest the PCs. Read or paraphrase the following to the players:

> As you start to eat, a couple of grim bashers at the next table catch your attention. There are four of them, three men and a woman, all dressed in the garb and icons of the **Athar**. They seem more dour than usual, and the words that carry over to your table may explain why. "Another body was found," the woman says, eliciting oaths and curses from the men. "Who was it this time?" one asks. "A Guvner? A Hardhead? One of us?" The woman raises her hand for silence. "It was Keluk," she tells them, and each lets out a sorrowful sigh. "He was found near the Shattered Temple, killed like the others."

This beginning introduces the PCs to the murders that plague the Lower Ward and The Lady's Ward. The murders began about a week ago, and each night since one lawfully aligned faction member has ended up in the dead-book. Six bodies have been discovered to date, each from one of these factions: the Athar, the **Believers of the Source**, the **Fraternity of Order**, and the Harmonium. While no members of the **Doomguard** or the Mercykillers have turned up dead yet, both of these factions believe that it is only a matter of time until they get hit, too.

The PCs may question the Athar party or simply finish their meal and head out into the night. The crux of the plot has been planted, and there are plenty of scenes described in this chapter for pulling the PCs deeper into the story. If they do question the Athars, they don't learn a lot. The three male bashers only know the most common rumors, and the female cutter knows just a bit more.

**Sliding the Blinds:** If this scene isn't used as the starting point of the adventure, it can still be used once the PCs decide to look into the murders. All of the information available from the Athars can provide clues at any time early in this chapter.

### What the Male Bashers Know

If the PCs approach the male Athars in a friendly manner (offering to buy drinks, for example), the bashers open up. They gladly spill everything they know about the murders (which isn't much), especially if the PCs treat them like fonts of wisdom and knowledge. Here's what these members of the Lost can share with the PCs:

- Someone is murdering lawfully aligned members of factions in the Lower Ward and The Lady's Ward. (True.)
- The first body was found about one week ago by the Hardheads—the body of Old Favur of the Godsmen in a hovel in the Lower Ward. (True.)
- Two members of the Athar are among those who've been killed, most recently Keluk the Gray. (True.)
- Each body has had the blood drained from it, and each crime scene has been remarkably clean of blood. (False.)
- The murder victims were each discovered with the symbol of the Lady of Pain carved into their foreheads. (False.)

**Male Bashers (3) (Pl/var/F3/Athar/LN):** THAC0 18; #AT 1; Dmg 1d6 (short sword); AC 6 (scale mail); hp 12 each; MV 12; SZ M (5 feet tall); Int average (10); ML average (10); XP 65.

### What the Female Cutter Knows

The female faction member is harder to talk to than her male companions, refusing to answer questions if the PCs have any specialty priests or paladins among them. Even if they don't, she still doesn't trust strangers, and the current events have made her even more cautious than usual. She's wary of being tricked into something, or of giving away too much to a rival faction, or of unknowingly speaking to the murderer—after all, the berk could be anybody! Still, if nonpriest or nonpaladin PCs strike up a conversation with her, she eventually warms up and reveals some of what she knows:

- The Godsmen have been particularly active since the murders began, even going so far as to send out patrols to guard the area around the **Great Foundry**. (True.)

- **Factol Ambar** himself has been seen in the company of extremely dangerous-looking guards—and he didn't employ such guards before the murders began. (True.)
- The **Guvners** have offered a substantial reward for information leading to the capture of the murderer. (True.)
- The murderer isn't a regular berk at all, but a monster that's found its way into the Cage. (False; **Sougad Lawshredder** is the killer.)

**Female Cutter (Pl/♀ human/F6/Athar/N):** THAC0 15; #AT 1; Dmg 1d8 (long sword); AC 4 (banded mail); hp 32; MV 12; SZ M (6 feet tall); Int very (12); ML elite (14); XP 270.

## Quick Start III: Shopping Day

This opening can be used if the PCs have come to Sigil to purchase supplies and equipment, or if they're restocking their packs after a tough adventure. Eventually, they pass by a shop, **The Friendly Fiend**, with a picture of a smiling yugoloth (an arcanaloth) over the door. This shop, one of the best in the Lower Ward, has a reputation for fairness and quality—despite the fact that the shopkeeper is a greater yugoloth. If the PCs have spent any time at all in the Lower Ward, they've heard stories of this shop. It's said that some of the best adventuring supplies can be purchased at The Friendly Fiend, and for some of the best prices. In addition, the shopkeeper often has unusual items for sale. Magical items, enchanted arms and armor, and even goods from far-off planes can be purchased here, but quantities are extremely limited.

The shopkeeper, **A'kin** (Pl/♂ fiend/0/—/N), is an arcanaloth with a pleasant personality and friendly manner. Despite his fearsome appearance (he looks like a robed human with the head of a war dog), A'kin is one of the nicest yugoloths the PCs are likely to meet. He never has a foul word to say or a bad mood to pass on to his customers; on the contrary, A'kin makes friendly conversation and has many kind words to parcel out to those who visit his shop.

If the PCs enter the shop, A'kin rushes over to greet them. He offers cups of hot tea or mugs of sweet wine as he cheerfully calls out, "Welcome, friends, welcome!" The PCs may be unbalanced by a friendly fiend, but they should also remember that anything is possible in Sigil. A'kin never uses a hard sell; fact is, he takes forever to get around to selling anything. Instead, he talks about the weather, local news, amusing anecdotes, and the rash of murders that have been plaguing the Lower Ward and The Lady's Ward. "Terrible," he says of the murders, "What kind of foul creature would kill berks in cold blood?"

After a bit more small talk, A'kin asks if the PCs are looking for anything in particular or just browsing. He's recently acquired an item they might be interested in, though he's embarrassed by how much he'll have to charge for it. "Now, where did I put it?" he ponders, as the door swings open and another customer wanders in. Read:

> The chimes over the door announce the arrival of another customer. It's a male elf, dressed in amber and silver robes. He wears the bladed-head icon of the Lady of Pain around his neck, and a serene smile graces his handsome face.
>
> "I am new to your city, friend shopkeeper," the elf calls out. "Could you direct me to Bloodgem Park?"

The elf, **Halelfar** (Pr/♂ elf/0/—/LG), recently found himself on the Outlands after spending the better part of his life on a nameless prime world. He's one of the Clueless, but he heard the words of Trolan and decided to take up the worship of the Lady of Pain. Halelfar paid for passage to Sigil with the last of his savings (passage being a gate key and directions to the proper gate), and now he's come to pay homage to the Lady with the other recent converts to Trolan's religion.

> "It's not far, my friend," A'kin replies, "but not all visitors to the Cage know the chant, if you tumble to my meaning. That symbol you wear, for instance—such an open display will get you in the dead-book before you ever reach Bloodgem Park."
>
> "Thanks for your concern, shopkeeper," the elf smiles, "but my love of the Lady will keep me safe."
>
> "Your love of the Lady will get you killed," A'kin says with obvious sorrow. "Take a right at the end of the block, then go two blocks straight. Stay away from the alleys and try to keep the icon hidden."

Halelfar nods and walks back into the street, making no move to hide the icon. If the PCs ask A'kin what that was all about, the yugoloth explains that some barmy has started a religion dedicated to the Lady of Pain.

"If there's one thing our high-up hates, it's overt worship and devotion." The arcanaloth goes on to explain that the Cage has been receiving lots of new arrivals spouting the praises of the Lady of Pain. "Don't they know what the Lady does to those who bow down to her?" he asks rhetorically. "Don't they realize her very gaze slices bloody gashes across the flesh?"

If the PCs go after Halelfar and question him, they can learn some details about the new religion.

> "We love the Lady of Pain," the elf says with obvious devotion. "She is our moon, our sun, the very air we breathe. Without her love, we are nothing, so we have come to Sigil to court her and bask in her overwhelming beauty. You should join us, my friends, for the Lady will love you, too. We gather in Bloodgem Park two nights from now. The Lady can hardly refuse to respond to all of our affection."

With that, Halelfar strides toward the park.

Back at the shop, if the PCs remind A'kin that he was about to show them some wondrous item, the arcanaloth's face lights up and he calls toward a curtained doorway. "Balaka, my dear, please bring out the long box on the work table." A moment later, a beautiful, red-haired female with feathery wings steps from behind the curtain, carrying an oblong box. **Balaka** (Pl/♀ fiend/0/—/LE), an erinyes, is a lesser baatezu who works for A'kin; shy and quiet, she's as unusual a fiend as her employer.

The box contains a **long sword of the planes**, a blade with a black jewel in its pommel that glows with the energy of the multiverse. It looks as though a portion of space, complete with stars and glowing gases, has been trapped within the jewel. However, A'kin won't identify the sword for what it is, merely commenting on its beautiful workmanship and noting that it has some minor enchantments on it. After some haggling, the lowest price he'll accept is 4,000 gp. If the PCs can't afford his price now, he'll gladly hold the sword for them until later—for a small down payment of 100 gp.

The long sword of the planes has the following attack and damage roll bonuses when used on the specified planes or against opponents from those planes: Prime Material Plane, +1; Inner Planes, +2; Outer Planes, +3; Astral or Ethereal Planes, +4. However, the PCs must figure out how the sword works on their own; A'kin claims not to know.

**The Real Chant:** A'kin the shopkeeper really is a friendly fiend. That doesn't mean he doesn't have his own agenda, but such intrigues are left to crafty DMs. As far as this adventure is concerned, A'kin can provide the PCs with information and supplies they wouldn't normally have access to. For example, if they stay on the arcanaloth's good side, they can come back to the shop later and ask about succubi, cambions, or other things that have to do with fiends. A'kin shouldn't be used to give them all the answers, but he can provide hints, clues, and information if the PCs are having trouble, or reward them if they're doing particularly well.

**Sliding the Blinds:** If the DM uses a different opening sequence, this encounter should still occur early in the adventure. As the PCs wander about the Lower Ward or specifically search the city for clues, eventually they pass by The Friendly Fiend. If they ask around, A'kin is described as a wonderful and entertaining source of information.

**DM Note:** While the PCs are in the shop, they should notice that several items for sale (banners, mugs, etc.) feature the icon of the Abyss: an arrow pointing downward through the center of an infinity symbol. Don't make it a big issue; simply mention the icon in passing and allow a PC to ask A'kin what it means. That way, when the PCs later see the same icon in Harbinger House, the revelation will have added significance—and terror.

---

## Building the Story

After one of the three openings gets the PCs into the adventure, the main thrust of this chapter is the murders. Even if the PCs initially decide to stay out of the investigation, events happening around them eventually pull them right into the middle of things. If the PCs don't take the initiative, they can become suspects in the Harmonium's investigation; they can be hired by one of the most concerned factions (probably the Athar or the Guvners) to catch the murderer; or they might be approached by the Godsmen to capture Sougad and return him to Harbinger House.

The rest of this chapter is broken down into the following major sections:

- **"Getting the Chant"** (pp. 17-19), which details what the PCs might learn from Narcovi (the Harmonium's investigator), what they might hear from the typical sod on the street, and what's really going on with Sougad's murderous ritual.
- **"Scenes of the Crime"** (pp. 19-24), which details encounters at the sites of the first six murders (committed before the adventure begins).
- **"Looking for Clues"** (pp. 24-28), which provides six other related events that might take place during the PCs' investigation of the murders.
- **"Incidental Encounters"** (pp. 28-30), which provides numerous quick encounters to flesh out the story and give the PCs hints of things to come.
- **"Sougad and the Lady"** (pp. 30-31), which takes the PCs through the dramatic conclusion to the chapter.

The DM should not simply move the PCs through each encounter in the order presented in this chapter. Instead, let the PCs explore as they wish, and throw in various scenes as the story seems to call for them. For example, the PCs can investigate a murder site, then have an incidental encounter, then investigate two more murder sites, then have one of the encounters from "Looking for Clues," and so on.

Everything should build toward the climax of this chapter, "Sougad and the Lady," which takes place once the PCs track Sougad to his hiding spot in a warehouse.

## Getting the Chant

However it happens, the PCs do get drawn into the murder investigation. If they agree to assist a particular faction (or more than one if their group has the proper mix of members) and they ask for information, they're directed to seek out Narcovi, the special investigator assigned by the Harmonium to look into the case. Some factions suggest cooperating with Narcovi; others urge the PCs to find out what she knows by more covert means. When the PCs go looking for her, refer to "Narcovi's Chant" on page 24 for the full encounter. The section below merely details what kind of information the PCs can pick up from her notebook.

### Getting Narcovi's Notebook

The PCs can learn a few facts and lots of false rumors concerning the six murders that have occurred over the past six days just by talking to residents of the Cage. Their best bet, however, is to get the notes that've been compiled by Narcovi. They can "borrow" her notebook if they're so inclined, but if she catches them they'll jump to the top of her list of suspects. They can also ask her for the notebook if they've been hired by a faction allied with the Harmonium (either the Guvners or the Mercykillers).

On page 18 is a handout of a section of Narcovi's notebook. This lists all of the true details concerning the first six murders, providing the pertinent information—the whos, whats, wheres, whens, and possible whys of each specific death. This page may be photocopied for personal use and given to the players once their characters learn the facts (or steal the notebook) in the course of the adventure. However, the DM shouldn't let the PCs obtain the notebook until they've spent at least one day looking for clues on their own—don't make it too easy for them!

'Course, if the PCs never wind up with the notebook, the DM can use Narcovi's facts to add true information to the "embellishments" provided by various locals (see "Talking to Other Sods," below).

### Talking to Other Sods

The PCs can talk to any nonplayer characters the Dungeon Master wishes to provide, and the DM is encouraged to create "extras" on the fly. These should include the regular mix of street people, shopkeepers, innkeepers, serving girls, adventurers, city guards, faction members, and the occasional Clueless basher who might have seen something that someone else missed. However, no one who isn't directly involved in the investigation, didn't discover a body, or isn't in a position of authority in the wards knows all of the true facts of the murders. A particular extra may know one or two bits of true information, but the bulk of what he or she gives the PCs is rumor, gossip, or outright fiction. "Quick Start II" (page 14) provides a few false rumors, but a more comprehensive list appears below:

- Each body was partially eaten.
- The murderer took a different body part from each victim.
- All of the victims were members of a new faction (called the Overbloods) that's really an alliance of multiple factions; the murders are simply a prelude to a full-scale faction war.
- One victim was still alive when they found him, and he named his killer. It's one of the factols, so a cover-up is underway!
- "I discovered the third body near the Great Bazaar. Small red worms with black spikes covered the body like a second set of clothes."
- Large quantities of dust and ash were discovered at each murder site.
- The murder victims have disappeared from the Mortuary, and some claim to have seen them walking around the Lower Ward.
- The murderer doesn't use a weapon—the wounds were made with claws and teeth.
- "I heard a scream, ran into the alley, and saw a shadowy figure leaning over a poor young woman. I shouted, and the shadow turned into a mephit and flew away."
- There's no murderer. The Lady of Pain's killing lawful faction members to show her support of neutrality and chaos.

The information concerning the first six murders and the false rumors attached to those murders should be distributed a little at a time, as the PCs pursue their investigation.

### The Dark of the Murders

**Bancho Rake**, an evil wizard on the prime world of Toril, first developed the ritual that Sougad believes will turn him into a power. 'Course, the wizard had hoped to become a power himself, but with a barmy like Sougad Lawshredder in the picture, things don't always work out the way a body might like.

Rake took Sougad in as a young pup, recognizing the innate abilities that marked the boy as a special being—one with the spark of divinity. The wizard spent years developing an arcane rite, one that required both blood and planar energy. He planned to travel to Sigil, the city said to lie at the center of the multiverse. There, Sougad would spill lawful blood and absorb the resulting chaotic energy. Then Rake would absorb Sougad's bursting essence and become a power of murder and chaos.

### Narcovi's Notebook

*These notes might help me see something new. I hope so.*

**Night, six days past**

Body discovered in a hovel on Blood Bell, in the Lower Ward. Facts are as follows:

- Victim was a human male, about 80 years old, found in a set of sleeping robes decorated with the sunblade of Aoskar, the Believers of the Source.
- Victim had a terrified expression locked on his face, his eyes wide, his mouth twisted in fear.
- One massive cut across the victim's abdomen produced much blood and was the apparent cause of death. The flesh was sliced open with a large, sharp blade of some sort, probably a long sword.
- Two messages were discovered at the scene. The first was a hand-written note on a sheet of fine parchment. It read: "Chaos is the only law, washed clean in the blood of order." The second was scrawled across the wall in the victim's blood. The handwriting was identical to that on the note. It read: "Now it begins."
- Victim identified as **Favur** of the Believers of the Source, and a follower of the tenets of law. The hovel belongs to his faction.
- Victim was found by the housekeeper, a female gnome named **Eltiva**, who lives two doors down.

**Night, five days past**

Body discovered near the Shattered Temple. Facts known:

- Victim was a bariaur female, about 25 years old, identified as **Vienna** of the Athar.
- The following clues have led me to link this murder with the one committed last night. Victim wore a terrified expression, was killed by two cuts from a large, sharp blade, and a note on fine parchment matches the previous note exactly. There was no blood-written message this time. Those who knew her tell me she was of a lawful good persuasion.
- In addition to the victim, two other faction members were present in the bunkhouse last night—Defiant Munret and Karrin the Ancient. Karrin found the victim and called for assistance. Munret issued a statement, but the stink of bub around him makes his material worthless.

**Night, four days past**

A third body fitting the pattern of what I've come to call "the Law-Killer Murders" was found in a drinking hall named The Ascension, located near the Great Foundry. The facts:

- Victim was a female tiefling named **Lini**, a lawful neutral member of the Believers of the Source. She was killed by three slashes from a blade, had a look of fear etched on her face, and had a parchment note pinned to her tunic that read "Chaos is the only law, washed clean in the blood of order."
- The overturned tables lead me to believe that the victim was chased around the room before being killed. She also had a strange burn mark on her arm, possibly the result of some kind of magical discharge.

**Night, three days past**

The fourth victim of this heinous criminal was discovered in a library in the City Court. The facts:

- Victim was a human male identified as **Passa** of the Fraternity of Order. The same pattern repeats itself—a look of absolute fear, wounds made by a large, sharp blade (four this time), the note with the same message. The scrolls Passa was working on have been stained with his blood.
- One other thing: I found traces of a white powder around the floor of the room. I took a sample and have given it to our alchemists to analyze. I showed up early on the back marble steps of the library. I wonder if it was present at the other crime scenes?

**Night, two days past**

The latest victim of the Law-Killer has just made this situation extremely personal—I write with tears in my eyes:

- The victim was **Tenskor**, a member of my team of Harmonium investigators. He was obviously chosen as a warning to the rest of the faction. Slashed five times, starting with a shallow cut across his forehead and ending with a deep slash across his gut. Terror twisted his features and the note pinned to his sleeve had an extra line added to the familiar chant: "There is no safety in order, because chaos is everywhere."
- Tenskor was found on Harmonium Street in front of the City Barracks. He was staked to an X-shaped cross so that we'd all see him when we awoke. I found a small iron rod that was blackened as though a great amount of energy passed through it. No physical evidence was discovered, and none of the locals admit to hearing or seeing anything.

**Night, one day past**

The latest victim was found at The Parted Veil bookshop on Forgotten Lane by the store's owner. The details follow:

- Victim was a githzerai male named **Keluk the Gray**. The scene played like all the others: expression of genuine terror, killed by wounds made with a large blade (six slashes this time), a parchment note pinned to his shredded tunic. He was sprawled across a reading table, his blood staining a stack of books that explained the tenets of law and order.
- The shop owner, **Kesto Brighteyes**, discovered the body when he opened the store the next morning. He provided details on what he saw and assured me he didn't touch anything.

*For all these clues, I'm no closer to solving this maddening case than I was when the first victim was found. If only I had something new to go on...*

---

Sougad, however, didn't appreciate the implications of the plan. "After all, the essence is mine," he thought. "If anyone becomes a power, it should be me!"

Sougad bided his time, waiting for the wizard to finish his research. On the day Rake announced they would be traveling to Sigil, the barmy struck. He killed the wizard, took the scroll that contained the ritual, and used Rake's gate key to travel to the Cage by himself.

Completing the ritual is so important to Sougad that he's able to keep his inherently chaotic nature in check just enough to follow the steps. Make no mistake, berk—if successful, the ritual will make Sougad a lesser power. But here's the rest of the chant:

- The evil ritual can't bestow powerhood on anyone but Sougad or Trolan, because they already possess that elusive spark of divinity. It wouldn't have worked for Rake—and it won't work for Nari. As for the other so-called "powers-in-the-making" in Harbinger House, the ritual's effects are uncertain. (Hey, sod, the multiverse is full of mysteries.)
- This ritual is evil, like Sougad. Anyone who deliberately follows its steps should have a matching alignment—or suffer the consequences of a sudden alignment change.

The steps that could make Sougad a power of chaos and murder are as follows:

- A long sword must be fired in a forge whose fuel has been tainted with the blood of a chaotic being. (Sougad's already done this; see "Murder at Sod Dirk's Forge," on page 22.)
- Sougad must use the sword to kill 13 lawful beings on the Outlands (preferably, in Sigil itself). Each murder releases crimson planar energy; the sword absorbs that energy and shares it with the killer. Each victim must receive an exact number of slashes: the first takes one slash, the second takes two, etc. Thus, the thirteenth victim must receive 13 slashes. (By the time the adventure starts, Sougad's already killed six of the 13 sods.)
- Sougad must leave each corpse with a piece of parchment inscribed with these words: "Chaos is the only law, washed clean in the blood of order." The parchment must be of the finest quality, the ink must be the victim's own blood, and the quill must be a fresh vrock feather (thus, 13 vrock feathers are needed).
- The site of each killing must be prepared with the components of one of these three spells: *confusion* (three nutshells), *chaos* (a disc of bronze and a small iron rod), or *death spell* (a crushed black pearl worth no less than 1,000 gp). The components need to be placed within 10 feet of where the murder takes place. None of the three spells are actually cast; the components simply help power the transfer of planar energy and are only partially consumed in the process.
- Once 13 lawful beings have been killed with the prepared sword, the sword can then be used to turn Sougad or Trolan into a true power. The power-to-be must be slain with the sword. The person's mortal body dies, but the energy accumulated in the sword transforms him into a lesser power.

When Sougad was freed from Harbinger House, he took with him the scroll that details the ritual; the PCs might discover it later (in Chapter III). The barmy's also made a slight alteration to the process. The thirteenth murder must take place in the presence of both the planarity and the focrux, so Sougad plans to return to Harbinger House to commit the last few murders. Then, he'll plunge the sword into himself as the powerful energy of the planar items washes over him.

**DM Note:** With each partial completion of the ritual (every few victims killed), Sougad receives additional innate powers, as detailed throughout the adventure. However, he won't become a full power until he finishes the whole ritual, and hopefully, the PCs will stop that from happening.

## Scenes of the Crime

The sites of Sougad's first six murders are described below. They appear in the order the murders were committed, but the PCs can check them out in any order they choose. Remember to intersperse scenes from the "Incidental Encounters" and "Looking for Clues" sections with visits to the various crime sites.

### The Hovel on Blood Boil

The first victim—**Old Favur**, the former custodian of Harbinger House—was discovered in a hovel near the House. Located one block from the House, the hovel is just one of many small dwellings owned by the Believers of the Source and used as temporary quarters for members of the faction.

When Favur retired from his post as custodian, he was assigned to this hovel until arrangements could be made on the Ethereal Plane for a permanent home. Sougad chose him as the first victim for two reasons. First, Nari wanted to get rid of Favur; he'd outlived his usefulness and couldn't be left alive to tell others about her. Second, when Sougad spent those long years as a "guest" of the House, the barmy swore he'd put Favur in the dead-book if ever given the chance.

One fact about the first murder that Narcovi's kept secret (but written in her notebook) is the message that was left at the scene. The words, written across one wall in Favur's blood, proclaimed, "Now it begins." If the PCs question the other residents of the area, they learn that an old woman named **Eltiva** (Pl/♀ gnome/0/Sign of One/N), who worked as Favur's housekeeper and lived two doors away, was the one who discovered the body. She saw the bloody message and can tell the PCs about it.

If the PCs search the murder site and any of them make successful Wisdom checks at −2, they discover two small objects jammed halfway into a crack in the hovel's wall, about 10 feet from where the body was found. These objects—a small bronze disc and a small iron rod—are the components for a *chaos* spell. Both have been partially consumed to power this portion of the ritual, but enough remains for the PCs to identify them.

**DM Note:** PCs with the spellcraft proficiency can make an Intelligence check at −6 to identify the spell from the components (wizards of 8th level or higher make the check at −2). Other high-level wizards, including **Kesto Brighteyes** (see "The Parted Veil Bookshop" on page 22), can identify the spell and also determine that the components were not used in a normal spellcasting attempt.

### The Bunkhouse on Powers Row

Two murders have taken place in the shadow of the Shattered Temple. The first occurred five nights ago at an Athar bunkhouse located on Powers Row. The bunkhouse serves as living quarters for transient members of the faction and other Athar bashers who need a place to stay.

On the night in question, only three of the 12 rooms were occupied: Vienna the bariaur (the victim), **Defiant Munrot** (Pl/♂ halfling/0/Athar/CG), and **Kuarri the Ancient** (Pl/♂ tiefling/0/Athar/CN) were using the facilities. Neither Munrot nor Kuarri had rooms near Vienna, so what they can tell the PCs is limited. Kuarri found the body and can provide a few facts. Munrot, on the other hand, was extremely drunk at the time and barely heard a thing. Every bit of information he provides is false, as he decided to make up a complete story rather than admit he heard and saw nothing.

The bariaur's body was discovered in her straw-filled sleeping stall. If the PCs conduct their own search (and at least one PC makes a successful Wisdom check at −4), they discover two clues that Narcovi missed. A small patch of black dust stains the otherwise pristine floor beneath the straw—the remains of the crushed black pearl Sougad used to power this portion of the ritual. A successful appraising proficiency check can identify the material; the spellcraft proficiency (or a high-level wizard contact) can be used to identify its possible uses. See the DM Note under "The Hovel on Blood Boil," above, for more information.

The second clue is lodged within the straw: a vrock feather, its tip stained with the bariaur's blood. Sougad dropped it in the straw and didn't feel like digging around to find it. If the PCs have a high-level wizard contact, or if they're on good terms with A'kin the yugoloth, they can get the feather and the stain on its tip identified.

### The Ascension Drinking Hall

The third murder victim—the female tiefling **Lini**—was discovered in a Godsmen-frequented drinking hall near the Great Foundry. **The Ascension**, a high-class establishment on Gray Steam Path, is noted for its ethereal ale—a drink that literally evaporates on the tongue, quenches thirst, and produces a soothingly intoxicating effect.

By talking to assorted customers, serving wenches, and the owner, the PCs can uncover both facts and rumors at this location. The owner is **Julius of the Ninth Test** (Pl/♂ githyanki/0/Believers of the Source/NE), a Godsman who believes he's now in his ninth incarnation and getting increasingly closer to the Final Ascension. Though he's friendly and answers questions concerning the murder, he's more interested in spreading the doctrine of the Believers of the Source. (He can also tell the PCs about Harbinger House if they specifically question him about the place, but he won't reveal anything about it during casual conversation.)

A search of the premises reveals nothing beyond what Narcovi discovered, as the place has been thoroughly cleaned. If the PCs press Julius for more details, though, he remembers picking up three nutshells from beneath the smashed table where they found poor Lini. The shells are components for the *confusion* spell and were used to power this portion of the ritual. See the DM Note under "The Hovel on Blood Boil," above, for ways the PCs can gain details on the shells.

When the PCs leave The Ascension, the DM should have each make a Wisdom check at −4. Those who succeed notice that they're being followed; those who fail see nothing but still feel as though they're being watched. The follower is a young boy named **Urchend** (Pl/♂ human/0/Free League/LN). He's small, thin, and ragged, but his eyes are bright and alert. He lives on Sigil's streets and was sleeping in the alley across from The Ascension on the night of the murder.

Urchend is deathly afraid of the Harmonium because their guards routinely round up street people for no apparent reason, so he hid while Narcovi was conducting her investigation. He wants to let somebody know what he saw, however. If the PCs have been friendly toward other street people, Urchend approaches them; otherwise, the PCs spot him and can go to his hiding place. In either case, once the PCs demonstrate that they mean the boy no harm, Urchend stammers:

> "I spied the killin' in The Ascension four nights ago. It was dark, but I saw two shapes movin' around behind the windows. A basher chased a woman around the common room with a sword, but he weren't swingin' it at her. I could hear him laughin'—an evil, barmy sound. Then he touched her, and a flash like lightnin' lit up the room. The woman screamed, and I saw the berk in that quick flash o' light. He was tall and strong, with wild hair and fiery eyes. Then it got dark again. I could hear him hack her to bits with his sword, but I couldn't see nothin'—at least, not till I spied a sparkly red glow creep outta her body, slide up his sword, and make the berk shine bright, just for a wink."

Urchend didn't recognize the killer and can't tell the PCs anything more.

**The Real Chant:** The bright flash of light was created when Sougad used his *shocking grasp* ability to wound the woman. Once he'd killed her, planar energy—the red glow—flowed into his body through the sword.

### City Court Library

**Fassa**, the fourth victim to fall to Sougad's sword, was a member of the Fraternity of Order who had the misfortune to be working late three nights ago. The male human Guvner was in one of the Court's libraries, studying a stack of scrolls pertaining to the laws of commerce between Sigil and the merchant lords of the **Planar Trade Consortium**. His blood has permanently stained the scrolls.

When the PCs arrive at the **City Court**, they find that the library in question has been temporarily closed. If they're working for the Guvners, the Harmonium, or the Mercykillers, they're allowed to examine the area. Otherwise, they must sneak in, charm their way past a Guvner guard, or bribe one of the non-Guvner workers who serve the Court. However they do it, the PCs should eventually gain access to the murder site. In the library, the PCs witness the following:

> Pushing open the doors to the Court library, you're greeted with an unexpected sight. All of the shelves of scrolls and books have been shoved into the far corner, along with the reading tables and chairs. The rest of the chamber is bare, and four dabus are busy cleaning the walls, floor, and ceiling with brushes, mops, and brooms.
>
> "They've been at it since we removed the body two days ago," comments a voice from behind you. You turn with a start, recognizing the old man with the large red nose and bushy white mustache as **Factol Hashkar**, high-up of the Guvners. "I've never seen them behave like this, cleaning the same spots over and over. It doesn't bode well for the Cage, I fear. But enough about our silent friends. Do you have some business here, or should I summon my guards?"

**Factol Hashkar** (Pl(?)/♂ dwarf/0/Fraternity of Order/LN) has come to this library every two hours to watch the dabus repeat their cleaning ritual. He's frightened because something has unbalanced the Lady's order—an order the dabus usually represent. If the PCs aren't working for the factol yet, he asks them questions concerning their interest in the murders and their presence in a chamber that is off-limits to the general public. If the PCs show him the proper respect, answer truthfully, and don't act too chaotically, the factol asks them to work for the Fraternity of Order. "Stop the killer, and maybe the madness that has claimed the City of Doors will dissipate."

The dabus have cleaned up everything pertaining to the murder, including the small pile of black pearl dust used in the ritual. However, on a successful Wisdom check, one of the PCs notices that one of the dabus has split off from his fellows. He's working among the books that have been pushed aside, and is, in fact, cleaning the same book over and over again. If the PCs approach, the dabus allows them a few moments to inspect the tome; it's titled *Powers and Demipowers*. Bloodstains mar the pages of a chapter titled "Divine Ascension." (Sougad skimmed the chapter after murdering Fassa; the dabus noticed the residue of evil left behind.)

**DM Note:** If the PCs are leatherheaded enough to attack the dabus, use the following statistics for the four in the library. However, be aware that enough dabus can be summoned to easily kill or incapacitate the PCs if things start getting out of hand.

**Dabus (4 or var):** THAC0 15; #AT 1; Dmg 1d8 or by weapon; AC 7; HD 6; hp 26 each; MV 12; SD immune to spells that affect the surface beneath them or the air around them; SZ M (6 feet tall); Int very (12); AL N; ML steady (12); XP 420.

### Warning on Harmonium Street

The fifth murder occurred two nights ago, near the City Barracks. **Tenskor**, one of Narcovi's agents, was slaughtered and staked out on Harmonium Street for all the Hardheads to see.

PCs who come to the area seeking information won't find much. A few street people are willing to talk (or make up a story) for a bit of jink, but the majority of Hardheads won't give the PCs the time of day. In fact, if the PCs have already had a run-in with Narcovi and her agents (see "Narcovi's Chant" on page 24), coming to this part of town can be downright dangerous. The Hardheads can't wait to pin the blame on someone so the Mercykillers can punish the guilty and the murdered faction member can be avenged. The PCs could be hit with the blame if they're not careful.

One street bubber (Pl/♂ half-elf/0/Bleak Cabal/CE) picked up the remains of the bronze disc used to energize this portion of the ritual, and the DM may wish to allow the PCs to find and speak to him. Narcovi found the iron rod, but she hasn't made the connection that it's a component for casting a *chaos* spell.

While in this part of the Cage, the PCs come under the scrutiny of Sougad himself. He stalks Sigil during the day, looking for lawful-thinking berks to hunt and kill when darkness falls. Returning to the City Barracks in search of another member of Narcovi's investigating team, he notices the PCs. If they openly demonstrate that they're also looking into the murders, Sougad follows them for awhile. What's more, he uses his *know alignment* ability to identify any lawful members of the party. If there are any lawful PCs with obvious ties to a particular faction, Sougad randomly selects one of them to kill. In this case, Sougad attempts to commit two murders tonight—the marked PC and the Mercykiller victim from Harlique's vision. See "Harlique the Barmy" (page 26) and "The Next Victim" (page 27) for more information about the potential victim(s).

The PCs shouldn't encounter Sougad at this point in the adventure. If they notice they're being watched, Sougad escapes into the maze of alleys before any combat can take place. However, if the PCs have already met Urchend (see "The Ascension Drinking Hall" on page 20), they recognize Sougad from the youth's description. Although Sougad escapes, the PCs can find another clue: The spot where he was standing is marked by a small pile of white powder that fell from his boots and pant legs. The PCs can have the substance identified by an alchemist or the owner of a shop that sells fine powders and perfumes. It's talc, and only a few places in Sigil stock enough of it that someone could pick it up and track it around; see "Talc Warehouses" on page 25 for more information.

### The Parted Veil Bookshop

The sixth murder occurred the night before the start of the adventure in the vicinity of the Shattered Temple. The body of **Keluk the Gray** was found in **The Parted Veil**, a bookshop on Forgotten Lane.

**Kesto Brighteyes** (Pl/♂ gnome/W12/Athar/CN), the owner of the shop, told investigators he opened his store that morning (the morning that the adventure begins) and found Keluk's body. An Athar wizard, Kesto stocks his shop with books of philosophy that promote the beliefs of his faction, and Keluk—a fellow Athar—was in the shop at night conducting research. Kesto claims to know only what he already told Narcovi (the details are found in "Narcovi's Notebook," page 18). However, he hides the fact that he arrived much earlier than he claimed; fact is, Kesto walked in just as Sougad was drawing the red planar energy from the newly killed corpse. Sougad grabbed Kesto, used his *know alignment* power to discover that the wizard was not lawful, and warned him to keep his bone-box shut about the killing. Otherwise, the barmy promised to return and cut off Kesto's hands and tongue, leaving the wizard alive to know he'd never cast another spell again.

If the PCs convince Kesto that the murderer won't return to harm him, the wizard reveals what he saw, including the mysterious red glow that passed from Keluk's body to the killer. He describes Sougad in perfect detail and provides an important clue for finding him: White dust coated the murderer's black boots.

If the PCs search the shop and any make a successful Wisdom check at −2, they find a footprint of the dust, hidden beneath several books that fell on the floor. The white powder is talc, the same kind the PCs might find in "Warning on Harmonium Street," above. If the PCs point out the footprint, Kesto can examine and identify the dust. What's more, Kesto (or some other PC contact) can tell them where to find enough talc to coat boots so heavily: "Three warehouses in the area keep large stores of talc on hand for use in specific product manufacturing: Grassif's Paints, Penbrum's Parchments and Papers, and Logu's Bath Powder."

**The Real Chant:** Grassif's Paints owns a large storage warehouse a few blocks from Bloodgem Park; Sougad uses the warehouse as a hiding place during the day. See "Talc Warehouses" on page 25 for more information.

**DM Note:** The Parted Veil features a small section of magical texts. If the PCs are interested and don't go out of their way to antagonize Kesto, he can offer them a variety of spells (at the DM's discretion). He has four 1st-level, three 2nd-level, two 3rd-level, and one 4th-level spell available. He charges 500 gold pieces per level per spell. With some charm and haggling, a few compliments, and words of encouragement from a member of a friendly faction, Kesto can be persuaded to drop his price to 200 gp per level per spell.

## Looking for Clues

As the PCs search the Lower Ward and The Lady's Ward for clues concerning the murders, they're likely to run into the six encounters in this section. These scenes should be interspersed with scenes of the PCs checking out the murder sites and run in the order that makes the most sense to the way the adventure is progressing.

**DM Note:** The DM may expand this section to include other encounters as he sees fit.

### Narcovi's Chant

In her search for the killer, the Harmonium investigator Narcovi's got a squad of eight Hardhead agents backing her up, and plenty more nosing around the wards.

Several of these agents run into the PCs while they're conducting their own search of the murder sites (though who the PCs are working for, if anyone, may determine what kind of reception Narcovi gives them later). The Hardheads ask questions along the following lines: "Where were you last night around eighth lantern? What business do you have here? Can we take a look at your swords? Did you know the victim? Why are you so interested in a couple of routine murders?" The agents give the PCs a tough time, then wander off into the turns and twists of the Cage.

The Hardheads report to Narcovi as soon as they can, letting her know that a group of rough-looking berks is nosing around the murder sites. Narcovi gathers her agents and tries to locate the PCs, finding them at some point before the first day of the adventure ends.

Narcovi's been running into walls and dead-ends since this case began, so she's not going to be too nice to a bunch of adventurers who may know who the murderer is. Fact is, as far as Narcovi knows, one of the PCs could be the killer.

If the player characters are working for the Guvners, the Harmonium, or the Mercykillers, Narcovi goes a little easier on them. Otherwise, she treats them like suspects and asks tough questions. Some are the same ones her agents asked earlier, while others are more to the point: "Where have you been all day? Yesterday? Did anyone else see you there? What about six nights ago? Five? Four? Can you prove it? Why shouldn't I call the Mercykillers and have the bunch of you thrown into a very dark corner of the Prison?"

If the PCs refuse to cooperate, Narcovi has her agents haul them down to the City Barracks, where she can conduct a more thorough interview. 'Course, this could lead to a fight. While the agents are tough, the PCs should be able to escape if they try. In no case should Narcovi be killed during any such skirmishes. If a fight does break out, the PCs automatically become fugitives wanted for questioning by the Harmonium. From that point on, they'll have to be careful not to get spotted by any of Sigil's three spokes of justice—the Guvners, the Hardheads, or the Red Death—as members of these factions will be on the alert for anyone answering to the PCs' descriptions.

Unless the PCs are connected to one of the three factions mentioned above, Narcovi refuses to let them help her and won't share any of the evidence she's gathered, including the information in her notebook (on page 18). The PCs see her jot notes down, though, and they might get the idea to swipe the notebook at the next convenient opportunity. 'Course, once she notices it's missing, Narcovi comes looking for the PCs to confront them about it.

If the PCs answer all of Narcovi's questions honestly and with some modicum of respect, she'll let them go with a simple warning. "I don't know where you come from, but in Sigil it's the Harmonium that makes the arrests. Stay out of this and you'll stay healthier—and free."

**Harmonium Agents (8) (Pl/var/var/F5/Harmonium/LG):** THAC0 16; #AT 1; Dmg 1d8 (scimitar); AC 3 (banded mail); hp 25 each; MV 12; SZ M (6 feet tall); Int very (12); ML steady (12); XP 175.

### Sougad's Hideout

More than one lawful berk thinks that the **Xaositects** are behind the murders. **Factol Karan** has asked his Chaosmen to keep an eye on the events transpiring in the Lower Ward and The Lady's Ward, sensing that if the law-boys don't break the case soon, his faction is going to take the heat. Something this big could lead to a faction war, and even Karan isn't chaotic enough to want that. So, as the PCs carry out their own investigation, they may see a Xaositect or two spying from the shadows, sitting inconspicuously just within earshot, or even boldly approaching to ask them what they learned at a particular location.

If the PCs decide to turn the tables on the Xaositects and do some following of their own, they'll be led right to the Xaositect hideout in the Lower Ward. It's not too far from Harbinger House (the Chaosmen really want to discover the dark of that place), hidden in the basement of a sweets shop called **Happy Candies** (marked on one of the DM's maps of Sigil). The jumble of candies mixed randomly among a dozen bins is a clue that the shop is run by Chaosmen. The berk (Pl/♂ githzerai/0/Xaositects/CN) behind the counter makes for an interesting encounter. Prices change from moment to moment, conversation flows from topic to topic without any discernible pattern, and at times the shopkeeper even switches to the meaningless dialogue often used by members of this faction.

A trap door behind the counter leads down to the hideout. The PCs can try to convince the shopkeeper that they are members of the faction (which isn't hard unless any PCs wear obvious icons of other factions or lawful holy symbols), overpower the poor berk, or simply wait until the place closes and break in.

The basement is one large room, with cots scattered everywhere, a table and six chairs in one corner, and a small fire providing light. At any given time, four to nine (1d6+3) Chaosmen are present. Besides trying to get to the bottom of the murders themselves, these Chaosmen are preparing to defend themselves against attacks by other factions. The hideout is full of weapons they've gathered, including: 12 long swords, 16 short swords, eight spears, eight flasks of oil, 10 torches, 24 arrows, three short bows, and nine daggers (none of the weapons are magical). The PCs may see the weapons as "proof" that the Chaosmen are committing the murders, or as a response to the brutal accusations being made.

If the PCs enter the hideout in the company of a Chaosman PC or the shopkeeper (if they peeled him into believing they're faction members, for example), the Xaositects are willing to talk.

However, if the PCs barged in on their own, the Xaositects are hostile, thinking the group's come to arrest or attack them. The Chaosmen fight to the death, though one tries to escape to warn the rest of the faction. The PCs must fight to the end or convince the Chaosmen they've come in peace. The trick here is to discover that the Chaosmen, in their own way, are as upset about the murders as the lawful factions are. If the PCs learn that the Chaosmen aren't behind the killings, they can help keep a faction war from erupting by passing the word along to Factol Ambar or Narcovi.

**Chaosmen (1d6+3) (Pl/var/var/F2/Xaositects/CN):** THAC0 19; #AT 1; Dmg 1d6 (spear); AC 7 (ring mail); hp 11 each; MV 12; SZ M (6 feet tall); Int average (10); ML steady (12); XP 35.

### Talc Warehouses

Three warehouses in the area deal in talc, the substance the PCs may find on Harmonium Street (if they spot Sougad) and at The Parted Veil bookshop. **Penbrum's Parchments and Papers**, **Logu's Bath Powder**, and **Grassif's Paints** each have a warehouse in the area, and each make extensive use of talc. The warehouses are marked on the DM's maps of Sigil. Their locations are not secret, and the PCs should be able to find them without much trouble. For example, Kesto Brighteyes or another PC contact can direct the group to any of the three.

**Penbrum's Parchments and Papers:** Penbrum's Parchments and Papers has a large warehouse in The Lady's Ward, not far from the City Court. Most of the paper used by the Court comes from Penbrum's stores. If the PCs check out the warehouse, they must get past a complicated series of locks (−20% penalty to open lock rolls). However, a thorough search of the exterior of the building reveals another entrance: A loose board near the base of the back wall slides sideways to form a small but usable entrance. Only human-sized or smaller creatures can squeeze through the opening.

Inside the warehouse, a pack of cranium rats has made a nest in the paper stores. There are 40 rats in the pack, which has a collective Intelligence of 8 and two wizard spells (*color spray* and *hypnotism*). The pack has nothing to do with the murders but reacts badly to anything that threatens the nest. If the PCs enter the warehouse and start looking around, the rats stalk them and wait for opportunities to strike. If **Penbrum** is informed about the rat infestation, he offers the PCs a reward of 500 gold pieces for clearing out his warehouse.

**Cranium Rats (40):** THAC0 19; #AT 1; Dmg 1d4; AC 6; HD 1; hp 7 each; MV 15; SA wizard spells (*color spray*, *hypnotism*); SD save as creature of Hit Dice equal to group Intelligence; SZ T (6 inches long); Int var (1 point per every five living rats); AL NE; ML unsteady (7); XP 65.

**Logu's Bath Powder:** Logu's Bath Powder provides its products to the bath houses frequented by the Ciphers. The business has one warehouse in the vicinity, a medium-sized building in the Lower Ward, not far from the Armory. Casks and boxes of powder made from talc fill the interior in orderly rows. If the PCs decide to explore this location, they discover that someone's living in the warehouse. Near the back, far from the normal traffic of the workers, a small den has been built. Casks and boxes make up the walls, while barrels form a crude table and chair. A bed of straw has been laid out in one corner. There are also the remains of recent meals, four empty wine skins, a few odds and ends, and a leather purse with the initials "LC" and the embroidered symbol of the Godsmen.

The purse belonged to **Lini**, the third victim. It was left at the murder site by Sougad and later picked up by **Baskix Three-Fingers** (Pl/♂ gnome/0/Free League/CN), a homeless drunk who's been secretly living in this warehouse for the past few weeks. He discovered Lini's body in The Ascension while on his way home from a cheaper drinking hall. Since the berk was already dead and there wasn't anyone around, Baskix took her purse and headed back to the warehouse. The PCs should be able to quickly determine that the drunk is harmless and incapable of killing anyone in the method that's been used thus far. However, Baskix can provide one additional bit of information about the third murder; he shows the PCs a vrock feather he found at the tavern, its tip stained with dried blood.

**Grassif's Paints:** This warehouse is located in the Lower Ward near Harbinger House, not far from Bloodgem Park. If the PCs take a look around inside, they find Sougad's lair. Skip to "Sougad and the Lady" on page 30 for the conclusion of this chapter of the adventure.

### Spell Components

If the PCs follow the spell component angle, they can learn quite a lot about their quarry. A number of shops that cater to the arcane arts—including The Friendly Fiend—are marked on the DM's maps of Sigil on the gatefold screen. It's up to the DM to create the encounters if the PCs decide to visit any or all of these places. The PCs might also visit any shops introduced in previous adventures or seek out contacts they've used before.

Sougad purchased 13 sheets of the finest parchment from **Unrra's Arcana**. Each sheet bears three Ps—the watermark of Penbrum's Parchments and Papers. If the PCs describe Sougad (based on conversations with Kesto Brighteyes or Urchend), the shopkeeper (Pl/♀ tiefling/0/Transcendent Order/NE) recalls the man. "A creepy fellow. A perfect gentleman one moment, an abusive sod the next. He did pay in gold, though."

The clerk (Pr/♂ elf/0/Society of Sensation/LG) at another shop, **The Wizard's Mark**, doesn't remember anyone matching Sougad's description, but his store was broken into six nights back. "It was the oddest thing. Broke in as bold as a balor and took 12 vrock feathers from the jar over there. Nearly cleaned me out. As it is, the berk left me with only two. Oh, yes, the thief also lifted 12 nutshells, five bronze discs, and five iron rods."

Where did Sougad get the black pearls? From **The Sleepy Dwarf Gem Exchange**, of course. "Black pearls?" the dwarf (Pl/♂ dwarf/0/Fated/LN) behind the counter asks. "Why are you interested in black pearls?" The dwarf is suspicious because the last time someone came into his shop and asked to see his black pearls, he was robbed during the night. "Tall, powerfully built, with wild hair and fiery eyes," the dwarf remembers. "I'm sure it was him. Came in seven days ago. He asked specifically to look at black pearls worth 1,000 gp each. 'Very nice,' he said. 'Good day,' he said. Next morning, the lock's busted and I'm out four black pearls!"

### Harlique the Barmy

Sometime before nightfall on the first day of the PCs' investigation, a barmy from Harbinger House approaches to warn them about the impending seventh murder. If the PCs heed her advice, they may be able to stop the crime; however, if they ignore her, they'll have to deal with the fact that everything she told them later comes true.

The barmy is **Harlique Swifthand** (Pl/♀ tiefling/B1/—/CN), a young woman who carries herself as a carefree, fun-loving teenager but is haunted by terrible nightmares that strike even while she's awake. These nightmares are always prophetic in nature, showing her visions of gruesome events just before they actually take place. Because her visions come true, she was taken in by the Godsmen of Harbinger House, instead of winding up in the Hive. However, when Nari let Trolan and Sougad free, Harlique used her thieving abilities to escape.

At this point in the adventure, she's experienced each of the six murders through nightmares before the crimes took place. Last night, while the sixth murder was taking place, she dreamed the events of the seventh murder—the death of Kolz, the Mercykiller.

When the PCs meet Harlique, she looks as if she hasn't slept well in weeks. The DM should pick one of the PCs. Harlique saw that character battling Sougad in her dream and wants to enlist his aid. She approaches the group with a dance in her step but a haunted look in her eyes. She behaves like any other barmy they might meet, but an edge of sanity peeks through if the PCs look for it. Read the following:

> A young woman dressed in comfortable leathers and marked by long dark hair and haunted eyes dances toward you. "I know you," she sings, pointing at one of you. "I dreamed about you last night. You're going to fight the murderer." She never stops moving, spinning around you, bouncing, dancing, swaying.
>
> "I saw last night's murder," she says. "Except I guess it's really tonight's."

If the PCs refuse to deal with Harlique, she follows them around and tells them what she dreamed regardless of their complaints. If they attack her, she laughs, "Let it be on your heads, berks," and dances into the shadows of a nearby alley before any real harm can befall her. If she does manage to pass on her vision, read the following:

> "Listen to the chant, cutters," the strange young woman almost sings, closing her eyes though she continues to dance and spin in place. "I dreamed of the murderer last night. He's a barmy, like me, from the House on the dead-end street. I saw him at a bake shop across from the Prison, hiding in the shadows of the door. He waited as Sigil grew dark and fell asleep, watching the Prison with hateful eyes. When the Watch called out 'Six lanterns and all's well,' he slid from the shadows and struck. The killer killed a Mercykiller. Red Death. Blood. Seven slashes of a flashing sword. He laughs, and another man dies..."

Harlique trails off, her dream vision finished. She can't provide any other information on the next murder, the murderer, or the victim, but she can tell the PCs about Harbinger House if they ask specific questions. She doesn't know anything about Nari, Trolan, or Sougad, though she has seen all of them in her dreams.

**DM Note:** Six lanterns refers to the time of day. Starting with the fall of darkness, the Watch lights one lantern every hour; thus, six lanterns means six hours after full dark.

### The Next Victim

Nightfall of the first day of the adventure means that another murder (or two) is about to take place. Sougad's seventh victim will either be one of the PCs or the poor berk that Harlique saw in her nightmare. If one of the PCs was marked by Sougad during their investigation of the City Barracks (see "Warning on Harmonium Street" on page 22), that PC is the first target of Sougad's murderous nocturnal activities. If the PCs didn't go to the City Barracks, or if none of the PCs are of lawful alignment, the target of Sougad's murderous rage is the Mercykiller from Harlique's vision. Note that even if a PC is targeted by Sougad, the barmy still goes after the Mercykiller when the Prison watch calls out "six lanterns and all's well."

The attack on a PC occurs right after the lighting of the second lantern (two hours after dark). If possible, Sougad waits until the target PC is alone before moving in for the kill, but he'll attack a group as large as three to get at his intended victim. Sougad has no qualms about killing nonlawful characters, but every attack is designed to get him closer to the PC he wants to kill. If Sougad takes wounds totaling 25 or more hit points, he uses his *dimension door* power to get away. If he delivers a killing blow to the target PC, he slashes as many more times as needed to complete this portion of the ritual, drops a parchment note and the appropriate spell components, and, again, flees through a *dimension door*. (After the killing blow, all remaining slashes can be delivered in a single round.)

This shouldn't be the final battle with Sougad, and the DM is urged to play him in an intelligent and ruthless fashion. He strikes to kill, uses his abilities to his best advantage, and escapes when the odds turn against him.

By the time the sixth lantern of the evening is lit, Sougad's in the shadows of **Geldab's Bakery**, watching the Prison until a Mercykiller victim comes along. If he battled the PCs earlier in the night, he took time to get himself healed before taking this position. Sougad's particularly eager to make a kill if the PC victim eluded him. The Mercykiller target is a basher named **Kolz** (Pl/♂ human/F4/Mercykillers/LG), who's on his way to a tavern after a long day guarding the residents of the Prison. Kolz's scale mail grants him an Armor Class of 6. The PCs can be in place to save him if they heeded Harlique's warning (see "Harlique the Barmy" on page 26). Otherwise, they learn about the murder in the morning after the body is discovered.

If the PCs are on hand to save Kolz, they have to act quickly. Though Harlique saw Sougad deliver seven slashes with his sword, it's the fourth strike that actually kills Kolz; the last three slashes are just Sougad completing this portion of the ritual. Though the PCs can easily find the bake shop, spotting Sougad is another matter. A successful Wisdom check with a −6 penalty is required to find his hiding place. Otherwise, they have to wait until he strikes to see him. If the PCs can cause more than 25 points of damage to Sougad before he delivers four blows to Kolz, the murderer flees and the Mercykiller is saved. If not, Sougad slashes Kolz four times and then retreats, though, if possible, he tries to get in three more hits before fleeing (as required by the ritual).

**DM Note:** If Sougad successfully slashes Kolz seven times, the PCs witness the transfer of planar energy—a red glow seems to be sucked out of the corpse, pour into Sougad's sword, and dissipate throughout the barmy's whole body.

**Sliding the Blinds:** If the PCs don't discover Sougad's hideout in the talc warehouse (Grassif's Paints) by the second night of the adventure, the DM must determine another target from the possible factions listed in the "Introduction" for an eighth victim (or a ninth, if a PC was also killed). If the PCs still haven't found Sougad's hideout by the third night of the adventure, the DM should steer the group toward the conclusion of the chapter—allow an NPC to provide hints, bring forward a witness who's spotted someone living in the warehouse, and so on.

## Incidental Encounters

As the PCs travel through the Lower Ward and The Lady's Ward in search of the murderer, the DM should use these incidental encounters to add flavor to Sigil, demonstrate the odd behavior of the dabus, and provide hints concerning events that'll take place in Chapter II and Chapter III. The DM should also feel free to add other encounters to this mix as he sees fit.

### Murder at Sod Dirk's Forge

The first murder Sougad actually committed upon being set free from Harbinger House was the one needed to prepare his long sword for the ritual. He found a forge, a long sword, and a chaotic being at **Sod Dirk's Forge**. **Sod Dirk**, a half-elf who was working late on a commission for **Kaldoron of Ysguard**, never saw the attack coming. Sougad used his *shocking grasp* to knock Dirk out. Then, using the long sword Dirk was working on, he killed the half-elf and spilled his blood into the fire.

No one has connected this murder with the others since the victim was not lawful, but the PCs could hear about the incident from a number of sources. Kaldoron (Pl/♂ dwarf/F5/Mercykillers/LG), in particular, has been moaning about the loss of his long sword in the local taverns.

### Indep Bashers

Sometime during the PCs' investigation of the murders, Nari the succubus learns of their involvement. While she isn't particularly concerned about cutters like them, she doesn't want to take any chances. So she approaches a group of Indep bashers in human form and spins a sad tale. "The cutters attacked me 'cause I don't belong to a faction," Nari cries, letting her tears flow freely. "They took my coin pouch and said they'd find me later so they could have some more fun." This really makes the bashers mad; to them, it's just another sign of the indignities that all Indeps must suffer. The Indeps decide to teach the PCs a lesson—which is exactly how Nari hoped they'd respond.

Ten Indep bashers soon find the PCs and get right to the point. Read:

> You suddenly find yourselves surrounded by ten of the meanest bashers you've ever seen. They wear the symbol of the Free League, which means anyone could have hired them to come after you. "You berks need to learn some manners," one of the bashers sneers as he hefts his weapon. "And while we're teaching you, maybe you'd like to return the lady's pouch and save yourselves a second beating."

The bashers don't want to kill the PCs, but they will match force for force. If more than half of the bashers fall, the rest try to escape. If the PCs manage to capture an Indep for questioning, he tells them all about what Nari said. However, he can't name her, he doesn't know how to find her, and the description fits any number of young women in the Cage.

**Indep Bashers (10) (Pl/var/var/F3/Free League/var):** THAC0 18; #AT 1; Dmg 1d6 (mace) or 1d8 (battle axe); AC 5 (chain mail); hp 17 each; MV 12; SZ M (6 feet tall); Int average (9); ML average (10); XP 65.

### Strange Dabus

The PCs have already seen some of the strange behavior exhibited by the dabus. The following examples can also be sprinkled throughout the rest of the encounters in this chapter.

- On one street, a group of dabus slice away or hack through razorvine. The PCs have seen the dabus perform this function before; it's one of their main jobs in Sigil. However, this time there isn't any razorvine in sight. The dabus have already cut and collected the plant from this area, but they continue to work at it as though the street was covered with the nasty growth.
- On another street, a group of dabus go through the motions of trapping and killing vermin. However, there are no vermin present—only the dabus who endlessly track, bag, and kill nonexistent creatures.
- The dabus work to repair things that aren't broken. They repave cobbled streets, hammer nails into solid boards, and replace intact windows with new panes of glass as the nervous crowds pass by.

Finally, there are many possible examples of the dabus cleaning areas that already sparkle. They sweep unseen dust from the streets, scrub unseen dirt from walls, and wash windows that already shine. They are especially active in the vicinity of Harbinger House and around the murder sites.

**DM Note:** If the PCs attack the dabus, use the following statistics, keeping in mind that enough dabus can be summoned to easily put the PCs down.

**Dabus (var):** THAC0 15; #AT 1; Dmg 1d8 or by weapon; AC 7; HD 6; hp 26 each; MV 12; SD immune to spells that affect the surface beneath them or the air around them; SZ M (6 feet tall); Int very (12); AL N; ML steady (12); XP 420.

### Attack on Factol Ambar

Nari wants the planarity, which means she has to find a way to get it from **Factol Ambar**. Since Sougad escaped and the murders began, the factol's surrounded himself with a collection of guards. However, Nari's called in a favor from Crimjak, the marquis cambion, and employed him to help steal the planarity.

While investigating the murder site at The Ascension drinking hall, the PCs hear the sounds of a nearby battle; if they don't respond immediately, shouts for help reach their ears. When they do arrive at the scene of the fight, they see Crimjak making short work of Factol Ambar's personal guards, having already taken down half and steadily working his way through the remaining bashers.

During the confusion, a thief charmed by Nari gets close to **Ambar** (Pl/♂ half-elf/R20/Believers of the Source/NG) and plucks the planarity—pouch and all—from the factol's belt. Crimjak continues the fight until the thief, **Tarrin**, has a chance to steal the item and get away. The factol notices the red-haired young man but thinks nothing of his presence while the battle rages.

If the PCs rush to help the guards, together their power can drive off the cambion, who gladly teleports away anyway as soon as Tarrin's escaped with the planarity. Afterward, when Ambar notices that the artifact is missing, he remembers how close the red-haired stranger got. He provides the PCs with an accurate description and promises to reward them if they can recover the pouch and its contents. He also gives them each 100 gp for the aid they provided his guards.

**The Real Chant:** Ambar won't divulge much about the planarity beyond a physical description, but he does tell the PCs that the item itself will be able to identify the thief—a subtle reference to its power to record and store images.

**Sliding the Blinds:** If the PCs don't participate in this encounter, the DM should assume that it takes place anyway, and that the planarity ends up in Nari's hands.

### The Thief Again

Nari wants to frame the PCs for a murder that looks remarkably like one Sougad would commit. She plans to charm a basher into killing a lawful sod with three sword slashes and leave behind an item stolen from one of the PCs.

A few hours after the attack on Factol Ambar, Tarrin the thief tries to steal something from the PCs as they walk through Sigil's streets—any item that can be traced back to the group. If the PCs catch him in the act, they can question him about the object he stole from Factol Ambar. Tarrin doesn't know a lot, and it's obvious that he's been charmed in some way. He doesn't know Nari's name, where to find her, or what she did with the item. Read:

> "I don't have it," the thief says with a wide smile. "I gave it to the beautiful woman. She wanted it so badly, I just had to get it for her. The same's true of your item. Let me give it to her!"

Tarrin does know he's supposed to meet "her" in Bloodgem Park after completing his present mission. If the PCs go to the park, Nari spots them from her hiding place in the shadows of a copse of trees and realizes that Tarrin has failed. She disappears before the PCs even realize she's there.

On the other hand, if Tarrin successfully steals an item from the PCs, Narcovi returns to see them the next day to discuss why an item of theirs was found at the scene of another murder victim.

**Tarrin (Pl/♂ human/T8/Revolutionary League/CN):** THAC0 17; #AT 1; Dmg 1d4+4 (dagger +4); AC 6 (studded leather +1); hp 35; MV 12; SA backstab x3, PP 70%; SZ M (5 feet tall); Int very (12); ML steady (11); XP 975.

### The Cult of the Lady

Throughout the murder investigation, members of Those Who Court the Lady continue to arrive in Sigil. Use these three separate encounters to show the PCs that this cult may play a larger role as the story unfolds. Statistics for a typical cultist—and for the bullies in "Discrimination"—appear at the end of the three encounters.

**Discrimination:** Because worship of the Lady of Pain is strictly forbidden, Those Who Court the Lady must deal with undisguised discrimination. Some cultists are thrown out of shops and inns by angry mobs. Others are refused even the most basic services in order to make them move on. The worst offense, however, occurs when a group of five bullies decide to beat up a cultist because of his beliefs. The PCs wander by just as things begin to heat up. Read:

> "We don't want your kind here, you barmy," an angry voice shouts from down a nearby alley. You see one of the cult members, dressed in silver and amber robes and adorned with the bladed head of the Lady of Pain, surrounded by five toughs. "We're just taking care of you before the Lady does it herself," another basher adds. Then they start hitting the cultist, who doesn't even lift a hand to defend himself.

If the PCs just walk by, the cultist dies from the beating he receives. If the PCs go to his aid, the toughs call them barmy "for helping a berk who's already in the dead-book" and attack. The five bashers fight until two of their number fall, then flee. The cultist thanks the PCs for their help, but adds, "The Lady would've protected me."

**Arrival:** Somewhere in the Lower Ward, a portal glows and opens while the PCs walk by. Six men in amber and silver robes step through, wearing wide smiles and looking around in bewilderment. "Can you direct us to Bloodgem Park?" one of the cultists asks. If the PCs question them, the cultists explain, "We've heard the words of Trolan and have fallen in love with the Lady. Now we've come to show her our love and devotion."

**Preparations:** Near Bloodgem Park, the cultists grow in number to almost 20. While many of them seek out items in the neighboring shops that can be used in their ceremony, a few move out into the streets to beg for donations and preach the words of Trolan the Prophet. The shopkeepers who agree to sell to the cultists can tell the PCs that they bought the strangest things. "Soaps, candies, flowers, beads—it's like they're courting young ladies," one shopkeeper (Pl/♀ bariaur/0/Doomguard/CN) says. Fact is, that's exactly what the cultists are doing—they're courting the Lady of Pain.

The devotees of the Lady who go begging and preaching spread words of love about Sigil's high-up. No one has ever spoken about the Lady of Pain in such flowery language. Indeed, the PCs can't remember when anyone really talked about her much at all. Read:

> "The Lady loves you, and you should show her your love in return," the preacher proclaims. "As Trolan the Beloved has said, the Lady is love, and her presence shines for all to see. Come to Bloodgem Park and join us, for to win the Lady's love is better than anything else the multiverse has to offer."

**Cultist:** THAC0 20; #AT 1; Dmg 1d3 (fists); AC 10 (robes); HD 1; hp 5 each; MV 12; SZ M (6 feet tall); Int average (10); AL var; ML champion (15); XP 15.

**Bullies (5) (Pl/var/githzerai/F3/var/var):** THAC0 18; #AT 1; Dmg 1d6 (short sword); AC 7 (studded leather); hp 16 each; MV 12; SZ M (6 feet tall); Int low (7); ML unsteady (7); XP 65.

## Sougad and the Lady

Eventually, the PCs should track Sougad to his hiding place in Grassif's warehouse. This encounter is written from that perspective; the DM can change the location of this scene but then must also adjust the player text accordingly. When the PCs find Sougad, read:

> You find a hidden lair in a dark corner of Grassif's warehouse. A bed, a map of the wards, clothes, a jug of wine, and a jar of Abyssal leeches mark this as someone's hiding place.

Sougad climbed up to a wooden beam near the ceiling as soon as he saw the PCs approach. When they begin to search the area, the barmy makes his presence known:

> Dust sprinkles down from above. There, standing on a support beam next to an open window, is the wild-haired man. His grin looks confident and evil, and he appears to crackle with power up in the shadows.
>
> He looks down at you and laughs. "Fools!" he shouts, as he leaps through the window onto the roof.

Sougad's decided to play a game with the PCs, hoping to lead them on a merry chase. No matter how long it takes them to reach the window and climb onto the roof of the warehouse, the barmy's waiting two roofs away in plain sight. "Over here, you mite on a bebilith's rear," he calls cheerfully. "You can't stop me from way over there!" He waves, hops to a flat roof, and starts running.

The DM should play the chase with as much excitement as the best chase scene from a favorite movie. Have the PCs make Dexterity checks to leap from roof to roof. A failed check indicates that a PC didn't quite make it; these

# Chapter II: The Outlands

Characters then have to make a second check to catch onto the side of a roof. Making the second check means that in the next round all that character can do is pull himself up to the roof. If the second check fails, the PC falls to the street below. The DM should roll 1d4 to determine how many stories the building has and calculate the damage from the fall (1d6 points for every story).

**Sougad** starts this scene two roofs ahead of the PCs. To determine how close the PCs might be able to get to him, the DM should roll initiative each round. A character can move from one roof to another in one round. If a character wants to run at top speed, he can try to advance two roofs instead of one. This, however, can be dangerous. Because the PC isn't being cautious, the leap to the first roof is made with a -3 penalty to the Dexterity check, and the leap to the second roof is made with a -6 penalty.

As the chase progresses, Sougad uses his cause fear power as the opportunity presents itself. He also uses shocking grasp if any PCs get close enough. However, he used dimension door earlier in the day and can't use that power to escape now. If he's on a higher roof than the PCs, he knocks over loose chimneys or drops other debris on them.

Eventually, Sougad leads the PCs to a specific four-story building across from **Bloodgem Park**. A number of free-standing arches are built all around the rooftop's edge. The barmy knows that one arch is actually a portal to the gate-town of **Ecstasy** (on the Outlands), and he's got a gate key in his pocket. It's here that Sougad draws his sword and turns to face the PCs in battle, secure that he can escape through the portal if necessary. If any PCs appear to be lawful (wearing symbols of lawful factions or powers), he attacks them first.

Meanwhile, in Bloodgem Park across the street, 20 members of **Those Who Court the Lady** have gathered to show their devotion to Sigil's high-up. The PCs notice the crowd peripherally, though the majority of their attention is probably focused on Sougad. As the PCs move to engage Sougad in battle, the crowd begins to chant. Read:

> "Hear us, Lady, for your beauty and grace have attracted us from across the planes," the crowd chants in unison. "Accept our gifts and love, and in return show the love you feel for us!"

The chant is repeated over and over as the battle rages on the rooftop; the PCs hear bits of it as their weapons clash with Sougad's law slayer blade.

Before the PCs can kill the barmy, he decides to escape through the portal and seek a few victims elsewhere on the Outlands. When the time is right, Sougad leaps in front of the arch, yelling to the PCs, "When next we meet, you will bow down before me! I will be Sougad Lawshredder, power of murder and chaos!" The DM should let the PCs make an initiative roll; any who roll 3 or less can take one action before Sougad leaps through the arch. However, while the PCs should be made to feel as though they had a chance to stop the murderer, under no circumstances should they be allowed to kill him or prevent him from escaping through the portal. After the PCs take their actions, Sougad plunges through the arch. Instead of falling to his death, he disappears as the arch briefly crackles with light.

Just as the battle with Sougad nears its end, a shadow crosses the rooftop. Any PCs who look up see the **Lady of Pain** floating above them and heading directly toward Bloodgem Park. Read:

> The chant grows louder, more intense, as the Lady of Pain draws near. Her shadow, as sharp as the blades protruding from her robes and headdress, slowly stretches toward the gathered crowd. As it draws closer, the chanters drop to their knees and present the gifts they brought her. The first cultist, flowers in hand, smiles happily as the Lady's shadow touches him. Then he screams in pain as blood pours from wounds that appear across his body — wounds that look like they were made by slashes from incredibly sharp blades. The cultists continue to chant, not one of them attempting to flee or beg for mercy. The shadow touches each one in turn, and in turn each one dies. It only takes a few moments, and then the Lady moves on, floating indifferently over the distant roofs.

Once Sougad escapes, the PCs can check on the cultists. Among the slashed corpses, they recognize **Halelfar**, the young elf from The Friendly Fiend. The elf is drenched with his own blood, but he isn't quite dead yet.

> Halelfar looks up at you, his eyes slowly losing the glow of life but his face shining with an expression of peace and happiness. He smiles at you, then whispers, "Did you see? She came to me. The Lady truly loves me." Then he dies.

With the Lady's passing, dabus and faction officials arrive to clean up the mess. One of these officials is **Narcovi**, who has lots of questions about what happened. Proceed to Chapter II, which opens with the resolution of the events in Bloodgem Park.

This part of the adventure takes the PCs to the Outlands in search of Sougad, the barmy who wants to become a power of chaos and murder. They might also be searching for **Trolan** and Those Who Court the Lady, especially if they accept a commission from **Factol Ambar**. In fact, Ambar could employ the PCs to solve both of the Godsmen's problems. If nothing else presents itself, **Kariana**, the sister of one of the dead cultists, approaches the PCs after she hears that they're going to the Outlands. She asks them to look for her younger brother, who's still following Trolan from gate-town to gate-town.

In Ecstasy, the PCs discover that Sougad's murder spree continues. Lawful sods visiting the gate-town are being put in the dead-book just like those killed in Sigil. Once the PCs track Sougad down, they engage him in another battle that ends with the barmy's apparent death. While in Ecstasy, they also learn more about Trolan and his followers. The PCs find that Trolan is leading a massive pilgrimage across the Outlands on its way to the Cage. A friendly cleric (actually **Pastor Browen**, Nari's servant) tells the PCs that if they hurry, they can catch up with Trolan in the gate-town of **Curst**.

In Curst, Trolan and his followers have become trapped within the razorvine-covered walls. The same thing happens to the PCs once they enter the burg, so they must find a way to escape the town. But first they have to deal with Pastor Browen, the Wall Watch, and members of the **Revolutionary League**. Time is against them, though; the majority of Trolan's followers bypassed Curst and are already on their way to Sigil. If the PCs don't escape in time, the cultists face the same fate as the group in Bloodgem Park.

As these major plots play out, the PCs discover more and more evidence linking all of these events to a place called **Harbinger House**. There's something going on in the House, and the solution to all the trouble might lie therein.

## Aftermath in the Park

The bodies of the 20 cultists lie cut and bleeding in Bloodgem Park. The spectacular tragedy has drawn the usual crowd of curiosity-seekers, as well as dabus and **Dustmen** intent on cleaning up the mess. Narcovi and her Harmonium agents arrive fairly quickly, trying to restore order and sort things out before the dabus clear away the evidence. If it wasn't obvious that the deaths were the work of the Lady of Pain, Narcovi might try to pin them on the PCs, as they happen to be in the thick of things once again. Instead, she asks the PCs about Sougad and the events in the park, then moves on to examine the bodies.

The dabus begin to clean away the blood and make the park presentable, but the actual removal of the bodies is left to the Dustmen. The Dead wait until Narcovi has examined the site before preparing the bodies for transport to the **Mortuary** (though what they want the victim's bodies for is left to inventive DMs and other PLANESCAPE adventures).

## Factol Ambar's Offer

After a brief amount of time passes, Factol Ambar approaches the PCs with guards in tow. He arrived on the scene right after Narcovi, once he was certain the area was secure. If the PCs have never met him, Ambar introduces himself and gets right to the dark of his visit. Read:

> "Terrible tragedy," the factol comments, "but the Cage's high-up has her rules. Let's all learn the lesson of breaking them." After some small talk, the factol drops his voice to a conspiratory whisper. "May I speak with you for a moment?" He directs you to a quieter corner of the park. "The **Believers of the Source** have a few... problems," the factol admits with obvious reluctance. "We face much embarrassment and loss of position if these troubles aren't settled quickly."

> The factol glances around nervously, then pulls you deeper into the shadows. "The law-killer Sougad is our responsibility, and I fear these violent deaths are as well. You see, we provide care for poor sods who appear to be barmy but are actually powers-in-the-making. Sougad escaped from our care, and so did one other; one who loves the Lady of Pain with all his heart. I fear he's passed his feelings on to those who are easily swayed."

Factol Ambar explains that the Godsmen maintain a shelter for these powers-to-be. He asks the PCs to recover the missing barmies before any more lives are lost, offering both jink and the gratitude of his faction. If the PCs agree, Ambar hands them the files on Trolan and Sougad (see "Factol Ambar's Files" on page 34, which should be photocopied and given to the players). He notes that all of the dead cultists came from Ecstasy, a gate-town on the Outlands — the best place to begin a search for Trolan. Ambar also asks about the portal Sougad used to escape. If the PCs point it out, Ambar sends one of his guards (a wizard) to check it out with a warp sense spell. A few moments later, the guard returns with the relevant information: The gate leads to Ecstasy, it requires a leaf from a star petal flower to activate, and it was indeed used in the recent past.

> "How fortunate for us," the factol says. "Perhaps this entire mess can be dealt with in one swift action. I will provide you with the necessary gate keys to speed you on your trip."

Ambar finishes by stressing that he doesn't want Trolan injured.

> "Trolan's not a villain in the sense that Sougad is," Ambar states emphatically. "He's just misguided by his love for someone who can't and won't reciprocate. Bring him back here without injury, and the Believers of the Source will take care of him. As for Sougad, deal with him as you see fit."

If the PCs refuse Ambar's offer, there are other ways to get them to Ecstasy. Narcovi could ask them to go on behalf of the Harmonium, as Sougad remains a threat that must be stopped. Kariana (see below) could convince them to rescue her brother from the cult's influence. Finally, if nothing else presents itself and the PCs refuse to leave Sigil, they could be tricked into heading to Ecstasy. Factol Ambar and Narcovi both have the means for planting a gate key on one of the PCs. In this case, at some point the PCs will step through an archway or door that's a portal to the gate-town and be transported to the location of Sougad's latest activities.

'Course, if the PCs don't accept Ambar's offer, they're not going to get his files on Trolan and Sougad (unless the DM wishes to allow them another means of obtaining the files).

## Factol Ambar's Files

### Sougad Lawshredder

This power-to-be in the making came to my attention about a decade ago when he committed a series of slayings here in the Cage. Over seven days, Sougad stalked, tortured, and killed members of factions who held lawful outlooks on the multiverse. The case was connected to the peculiar methods of death; each of the 11 victims was identified at the time of the death. Each murder was committed with the same weapon, a long sword blade believed to be a law slayer. Sougad wielded it as of slashes to equal the number of the victim — the first victim was killed with a single slash of the sword, while the eleventh victim received 11 slashes. He always left a note written with the victim's blood on the nearest wall, proclaiming "Chaos is the only Law, washed clean in the blood of order."

Incidental evidence alerted me to the fact that we weren't dealing with an ordinary barmy. Some victims had been bound in a discharge of magical power, and the descriptions that the gray-woman of the Dustmen provided of outer shadows led me to the Believers of the Source. Our researchers tracked him for Harbinger House — even potential powers need a place to develop before they ascend. The trail led directly to Sougad, and I stumbled across him as he was about to enter a hostile house in the Hive.

During my work to bring him the knowledge of ascension, I learned some important information about Sougad Lawshredder. He came from the prime world of Toril, where he was the ward of an evil wizard, and he came to Sigil for a specific purpose — to become a power of chaos and murder. Sougad has certain innate abilities that identify him as a power-to-be. He can cause fear, memory loss, and produce the effects of shocking grasp. He is resistant to magical effects, and any long sword he uses to commit a murder immediately becomes an enchanted law slayer weapon. His murders follow a definite pattern and are part of an elaborate ritual that he believes will elevate him to godhood. He refuses to provide details, but it appears that the ritual has granted additional abilities to Sougad, even though it went unfinished (he needed to complete 13 murders to complete the first cycle). Strangely enough, Sougad also likes to eat Abyssal leeches.

In the decade since we started working with him, Sougad's innate abilities have grown stronger. His hatred for law and order has not faded either. I fear that he'll never develop into a benign power, but that isn't our concern. When he reaches the full state of powerhood, we'll release him to find his place in the multiverse.

My greatest worry is Sougad's constant threats toward anyone who has ways of law. He believes that something monumental will occur after he's spilled the life blood of 13 lawful beings. He can't stand to return to the first cycle, so he'll have to remain in Harbinger House. Of course, I may be hindering a potential power by preventing Sougad from completing his ritual, but I can't contemplate that right now.

### Trolan the Beloved

Trolan of the First Slash came to Sigil following a dream most consider to be evidence of an addled mind. A brief look at his tale shows Trolan's place as a power-to-be. He was raised in the Outlands town of Ecstasy, where as a young man he developed the skills of a bard. Early on, he also showed signs of powerhood, for he developed innate abilities not usually available to mortals. When the powers that be first revealed themselves at the Tower of Wheels, his true goal became apparent — he wanted to win the Lady's love and devotion.

As anyone who's spent even a little time in the Cage knows, the Lady doesn't want devotion or worship. The rules are clear-cut: worship her and she puts you in the dead-book. The warnings didn't stop Trolan, however, and he arrived in Sigil and began to speak of his love in taverns and on street corners, hoping to prove his worth. Those who heard him were in terror of the Lady's impending wrath, and many bashers tried to silence him before the Lady did it herself. Days passed, and Trolan remained alive and unflayed. The Cage appeared to still keep a wary distance, afraid that the Lady's shadow would fall upon the bard. They'd be consumed by her sharp blades. Eventually, the dabus arrived to collect Trolan for his blatant disregard of Sigil's customs. But when they found him, they discovered that a host of dabus had surrounded the bard. These dabus carried him away, apparently ending the threat to Sigil. Ever more, there was only the joy.

The dabus brought Trolan to Harbinger House. We took him in, for it was rare indeed for the Lady's servants to bring anyone to us, let alone a barmy who seemed destined to be mazes-bound or cut down by the Lady's blades. I rendered my Enclave cast in service to the ballads, heard the love in his voice, and discovered innate abilities that marked him as a power-to-be. He can use the following spell-like abilities without the need for somatic gestures or material components: charm person, friends, suggestion, and enthrallment. He has a natural resistance to conjuration magic. He's also a friendly, good soul who will make a splendid power when he fully ascends the ladder of existence.

If not for his fatal attraction to the Lady of Pain, he wouldn't be in our care. His profuse and obvious sincere emotion and rich need for self-destruction led me to heal him of the Lady. He has special Trolan in his mind. Still, we can't leave him long in the Cage, so he remains our guest at Harbinger House until we find a way to curb his feelings and desires. After all, he won't achieve his place as a power if he forces the object of his affections to put him in the dead-book.

## Kariana's Plea

A young woman in the crowd shows more than morbid curiosity in the events that transpired in Bloodgem Park: **Kariana of Ecstasy** (Pr/♀ human/0/Fraternity of Order/LG), whose two brothers were inspired by Trolan's haunting words about the Lady and joined his cult. The older brother, **Benjim**, was among those who died when the Lady's shadow passed over the park. The younger boy, **Kedd**, barely 16, is still at Trolan's side.

Kariana wears a simple blue robe with its hood pulled up over her satin-black hair. She watches the clean-up from the edges of the crowd, listening to comments that ripple from one end of the park to the other. It doesn't take long for word to get around that the law-killer was chased out of Sigil and that the cutters responsible are the ones speaking to Factol Ambar.

Kariana waits until the PCs have finished talking to the factol before she approaches them. It doesn't matter what the outcome of their meeting with Ambar is; the PCs may still agree to help Kariana. Read:

> A figure in a blue, hooded robe walks toward you. While the figure's features are hidden, the shape beneath the robe is obviously female. She stops only a foot or two away from you, and you can see her large, dark eyes, pale skin, and wisps of black hair straying from the safety of her hood.
>
> "The chant's loud about you, cutters," she says in a sorrow-filled voice. "Did you really chase off the law-killer?"

If the PCs answer truthfully, Kariana points toward the body of a dark-haired man, his handsome face slashed open as if by a sharp razor. As a pair of Dustmen drape a sheet over the dead sod and prepare to lift him onto the waiting wagon, the woman chokes back tears. Read:

> "That's Benjim. My brother. He was a happy, content body back in Ecstasy. Then he heard Trolan's words, and they led him to his death." She pauses, watching her brother's corpse disappear into the back of the Dustmen's wagon. "My younger brother, Kedd, is still out there, letting Trolan fill his head with images of love. But there's no love for them here — just death. I need help. Will you help me?"

If the PCs are interested, Kariana explains that her brothers listened to Trolan speak in Ecstasy's Philosopher's Court, and both seemed different after the experience. "His words seeped into their souls. Both Benjim and Kedd fell in love with the Lady," she tells them. "Please — find Kedd before he makes a pilgrimage to the Cage. I'll pay you with everything I own." She holds out a small leather pouch containing 37 gold pieces, 62 silver pieces, and 45 copper pieces. It's the sum of her wealth, but she offers it all to the PCs if they agree to save her little brother.

## Nari's Fury

During all of this, **Nari** the succubus watches from the safety of the curious crowd, eager to see how much mayhem the events she's set in motion have caused. When she learns that Sougad has been chased off, her anger flares. It doesn't take her too long to find the cutters responsible for ruining this part of her plan.

Nari spends the rest of this scene observing the PCs and learning all she can about them. She doesn't interact with them at this time, but she does begin planning how to gain her revenge. The DM should assume that Nari can hear everything the PCs discuss in Bloodgem Park. This allows her to send Pastor Browen, a barmy from Harbinger House, to stop the PCs on the Outlands.

During the time that Nari observes them, the DM should give each PC one chance to spot her by making a Wisdom check at -4 (though not all at the same time). Any time a PC fails a check, he still sees something interesting: a strange or intriguing person in the crowd, Factol Ambar talking to Narcovi, Narcovi finding some possible clue in the blood-splattered grass, Kariana watching them, and so on. If any PC makes the check, he spots Nari — the most beautiful young woman the PC has ever seen. As soon as she notices that she's been spotted, Nari disappears into the crowd; the PCs can't catch her at this time.

**DM Note:** If a PC spots Nari in the crowd, she tries to use her charm ability on that PC (by winking or smiling). Secretly make the character's saving throw; failure indicates that the PC is charmed. However, charmed PCs should not be told that they're under Nari's spell. Fact is, they won't feel any differently at all at this point in the adventure.

Even if she succeeds in charming one or more PCs, Nari's not planning on "using" them for anything just yet. She simply wants to have as many people on her side as possible, in case she needs the help later.

## Ecstasy, City of Plinths

If the PCs agree to help the Godsmen, Factol Ambar provides them with a key to Sougad's portal; from the time the barmy escapes to the time the PCs get the key, two to three hours pass. If the PCs are traveling to the Outlands to hunt down Sougad at Narcovi's request, she puts them in touch with a **Cipher** who can provide a gate and a key; however, this could take as long as six to 10 hours. If the PCs are searching for Kedd at Kariana's request, the young woman can't provide them with a gate key at all; the group must find its own way out of the Cage.

The map on the inside of the gatefold screen details a portion of Ecstasy. It shows one of the temple districts, where most of the encounters in the town take place.

The numbered locations are described on pages 37-39. The buildings marked with "T"s are temples; however, the details of these places and the powers they're dedicated to are left to the DM. If appropriate, at least one of the temples should be dedicated to a power that means something to one of the PCs. Powers who have temples in Ecstasy include Isis, Ishtar, Chauntea, Enlil, Majere, Mishakal, and Lathander.

### A Quick Look

Here's a brief overview of this Outlands city. For more information on Ecstasy, refer to *A Player's Primer to the Outlands*.

Petitioners in Ecstasy spend days upon days contemplating the multiverse while sitting atop the many tall plinths that dot the landscape. It's a pastoral community, where no one is in any particular hurry to do anything except focus on his or her own personal growth. It's a place of peace and plenty, of gardens and orchards, of sprawling manors and buildings gathered at crossroads through the greenery.

While the petitioners tend to stay out of a body's way, the rest of the residents can be extremely impulsive. If you've got something they want, they're likely to take it. To these berks, the first impulse is the best impulse. Act before thought, or so the chant here goes — no wonder Ciphers and halflings make up a large chunk of the population.

There are three high-ups in Ecstasy — the **Sun Master** (currently, **Regialia Tonn**), the **Dark Hunter** (currently, **Karo Jantar**), and the **Philosopher King** (currently, **Kagorius**). The first rules the day, the second rules the night, and the third rules the debates that rage in the **Philosopher's Court**. There're also lots of temples to powers that might help a body out of a jam.

Visitors just need to remember that "evil" is considered to be anything that blocks a body's personal growth. So, buy a cool drink and find a comfortable pillar to perch on....

### The Current Chant

The PCs quickly learn some of the local chant as they explore the City of Plinths. The DM is encouraged to add details and create local NPCs as needed to pass along this information in a role-playing setting.

The annual plinth-climbing contest kicks off in a few days, and everyone is placing bets on the favorite and current champion, **Jeliva the Relaxed**. The PCs see many young men and women practicing their climbing techniques.

Many visitors of various multiversal views have come to Ecstasy to participate in the Philosopher King's annual **Gracious Debates** about the nature of existence. The inns are packed, the beer gardens are crowded, and the plinth-sitters are doing their best to ignore the commotion.

Unfortunately, the residents are more concerned with a recent rash of murders (they don't know that Sougad Lawshredder is the culprit). Remember, Sougad's ritual demands that he kill 13 lawful victims. He's already slain at least six in Sigil (in Chapter I), and he plans to kill the final three in Harbinger House (in Chapter III). Thus, in Ecstasy, he needs to commit enough murders to bring the total up to 10, which means that one to four victims must die.

The tenth murder takes place during the PCs' confrontation with Sougad at the Temple of the Beloved One (Area 5). So, by the time the PCs arrive in Ecstasy, all other murders have already been committed. Three possible victims and the locations where they were discovered are listed below. The DM should use only as many as is necessary, based on how many sods were killed in Chapter II.

- **Batoon, Cleric of Moradin:** This lawful good dwarf was killed in his room at The Impulsive Dabus inn (Area 4). He received the appropriate number of slashes from Sougad's long sword, had the parchment note pinned to his shirt, and had an expression of genuine terror etched across his face. If the PCs check his room, they find the remains of three nutshells next to the end table, less than 10 feet from where the body was found.

- **Kellise of the Fraternity of Order:** This human female Guvner was visiting Ecstasy to attend the Philosopher's Court. After the last session, she was on her way back to her room at The Impulsive Dabus when Sougad struck. Her body was found in the tall grass beside the road to Moondark Tower. In addition to the parchment note written in her own blood, the remains of a small iron rod were discovered partially buried in the soil beneath her body.

- **Derix the Blue:** This human male Mercykiller heard the PCs telling Narcovi how Sougad slipped the blinds back in Sigil. For the glory of his faction and to bring punishment down upon Sougad, Derix came to Ecstasy to find the elusive killer. He found Sougad, all right, but the barmy made short work of him. His body was discovered behind Miressa's townhouse (Area 3).

### Asking About Trolan

If the PCs want to learn more about Trolan, they've come to the right place. There are more than a few people who remember the tiefling. "He did something very few of us would ever do," one local might comment. "He got up off his plinth and went looking for his dream." Of course, his dream almost got him killed, and still might, but that's beside the point.

The following NPCs can tell the PCs what they remember of Trolan from his days in the City of Plinths:

- **Chereng** the bariaur, who was Trolan's best friend when they were children
- **Miressa**, daughter of the Philosopher King, who once loved the tiefling
- **Ogan**, owner of The Impulsive Dabus, an inn where Trolan used to spend much of his time

In addition to the information provided by these three bodies, the PCs can learn the facts mentioned in Ambar's file on Trolan (if they don't already have that information). Some residents might also talk about the strange powers Trolan began to exhibit just before he left town. He was able to sway crowds to his way of thinking with a few words and a penetrating stare. Even the most stubborn leatherhead couldn't disagree with Trolan for very long.

Those who didn't know Trolan in his younger days can tell the PCs about his latest visit to Ecstasy. This information is compressed into the dialogue below, though the DM is encouraged to spread the revelations among as many residents of Ecstasy as necessary for good role-playing.

> "Trolan? Oh, you mean the leader of the berks that worship the Lady of Pain? Yeah, I saw him. He was here about a week ago. He spoke at the crossroads, telling the crowds that gathered all about his love of the Lady and what she told him. He claimed she was ready to accept open devotion, and that he was her beloved but she still had room in her heart for all who adored her. He spoke from the top of an iron pillar, and his voice was like the music of the planes. He preached for a whole day, and then he charged those who felt as he did to go to Sigil and show the Lady their love. Almost a dozen berks left Ecstasy at his side the next day, along with another dozen who'd followed him here. It didn't end after he was gone, though. Others who'd heard his words decided that Trolan was more than just a prophet. They figured the cutter was a power. So they took one of the abandoned temples and dedicated it to Trolan. Hey, that's their right, if it helps their personal growth."

## Major Locations in Ecstasy

This section details five major locations in the gate-town and the encounters the PCs might have at each place, leading up to another battle with Sougad in Area 5 (the Temple dedicated to Trolan). The DM should embellish the encounters below as necessary for the unfolding story.

### 1. The Welcome Garden

Whether the PCs go through the rooftop arch to get to Ecstasy or arrive through some other gate, they step into a beautiful garden of colorful, fragrant flowers. The portal on this side is an elaborate, free-standing arch covered with leafy vines. In the distance, the PCs can see stone and iron plinths reaching into the sky, which identify the location as Ecstasy, the City of Plinths. After all of the PCs step from Sigil into the garden, read:

> Captivating fragrances and colors surround you as you step from Sigil's dusty streets into a garden paradise. Beyond the tops of the hedges that form a wall around the garden, you can see great stone and iron monoliths stretching toward the sky. The garden path winds lazily toward an opening in the wall, passing by bushes full of roses, star petals, and bright blossoms you can't identify.
>
> You also notice a halfling sitting on a short plinth beside the path. His eyes are closed, his legs crossed, and a contented smile stretches across his face. On the plinth, an open jug of ale waits within easy reach.
>
> "Welcome to Ecstasy, strangers," the halfling calls out without so much as opening an eye. "Care to take a load off and work on your personal growth? The greater good starts with each of us, I always say. By the way, have you brought anything to eat or drink with you? Self-improvement sure builds a body's appetite."

The greeter is **Artemor Far** (Pl/♂ halfling/0/Society of Sensation/NG), a transplant from Sheela Peryroyl's realm who found Ecstasy to be more to his liking. "Why farm," Artemor has been known to ask, "when I can spend time growing something even more to my liking — me?"

He's become something of a "welcome wagon" for this part of Ecstasy, greeting whoever arrives through the garden portal. Artemor enjoys good conversation, hearing news from other realms, and sharing whatever food and beverage his visitors have brought with them. Fact is, he's much friendlier and helpful to those who share something to eat and drink with him than to those who arrive empty-handed.

The halfling takes his time to get to the point, as he's in no particular hurry. If his visitors are impatient, he slows down even more, stretching stories or directions into long, convoluted conversations.

**If the PCs Ask About Sougad:** If the PCs arrived in Ecstasy through the same gate as Sougad, Artemor met the barmy murderer a few hours back. He remembers the wild hair, the fiery eyes, and the menacing long sword. He also remembers that Sougad wasn't particularly friendly; in fact, he was downright rude.

If the PCs used a different gate, Artemor never saw Sougad. However, he admits that a poor sod who was just passing through got put into the dead-book a few hours ago. "I heard that a cleric of Moradin was found all cut up over at The Impulsive Dabus," Artemor says. "Such a terrible thing to happen, even if it was a stuffy old dwarf."

**If the PCs Ask About Trolan:** Artemor hasn't been in Ecstasy for more than a few years, so he knows little about the bard who grew up among the plinths. He does know about Those Who Court the Lady, as they recruited some of the locals a few days back. If the PCs are patient enough to wait, Artemor eventually directs them to the new temple dedicated to Trolan, beloved of the Lady of Pain. "I haven't been there myself, you understand, but what started as just another expression of personal growth has become rather... restricting, if you catch my meaning. I'd stay away from that place if I were you."

### 2. Chereng's Stable

This finely appointed stable is the home of **Chereng** (Pl/♂ bariaur/0/Free League/CG), Trolan's childhood friend. Many of the older bodies in Ecstasy can direct the PCs here. The bariaur's sample dialogue follows; however, the DM shouldn't simply read the entire dialogue aloud. Instead, break it up according to how the PCs approach and question Chereng.

> "I knew Trolan," Chereng remembers. "We grew up together. I met him when we were both children. Trolan had just arrived, walking into the city on the road from the Outlands. He was only eight, but he apparently made his way here on his own. He never talked about it, but I knew he had been abandoned. We became fast friends, and his dreams and songs and stories were better than any words of wisdom spoken in the temples or shouted from the tops of the plinths. When I wanted to do something that was a little wicked or impinged on someone's personal space, Trolan would talk me out of it. Too bad I couldn't return the favor. He was a good soul, and I miss him a lot."

### 3. Miressa's Townhouse

**Miressa** (Pl/♀ human/0/—/NG), daughter of Kagorius, the Philosopher King, spends most of her time in the King's townhouse. The King set up this refuge as a place to get away from the rigors of the Philosopher's Court, but he rarely makes use of it himself.

As with Chereng's sample dialogue, the DM should parcel out the following information in normal conversation — not just read it from beginning to end.

> "Yes, I knew him. We were friends, then lovers. How I loved that young man! He had a voice like a summer's breeze and a smile that was brighter than the sun. Even my father liked him, for his bardic talents made him one of the best speakers at my father's debates. Not that Trolan spoke out often — at least, not before he heard about the Lady.
>
> "A cleric visited the city that year, on his way from Sigil to Elysium. He told stories about the City of Doors, and Trolan became fascinated with the images and chant of the place. When the cleric told him about the Lady of Pain, Trolan's eyes lit up with a fire that I could never ignite. He fell in love with Sigil's icon, composing songs and ballads to her while he was with me. Before the year ended, I knew that I had lost him. He said he was sorry. He said goodbye. Then he was gone, and my heart went with him. I tried to see him when he returned a few days ago, but he was still singing the Lady's praises. By the currents of Oceanus, how I hate her!"

If the PCs ask Miressa where Trolan went, she doesn't know, but suggests they check at the temple recently built in his name (Area 5). She also mentions The Impulsive Dabus (Area 4), a tavern where Trolan used to spend much of his time.

### 4. The Impulsive Dabus

This inn and tavern in the Temple District is run by a tiefling named **Ogan** (Pl/♂ tiefling/0/Fated/CN). Ogan's owned the place for years, and he gave a young Trolan his first job as a bard a long time ago. No matter what time of day the PCs visit The Impulsive Dabus, they find the place crowded, but friendly and very inviting. The recent murders in town have cast a bit of a pall over the tavern, but for the most part, things are still upbeat. Ogan is among the members of the community calling for action, as the murders seem directed against visitors to Ecstasy — the same bodies that come to his inn and spend lots of jink.

If the PCs ask Ogan about Trolan, they might learn the following information, revealed in bits and pieces during a normal conversation:

> "He was my best attraction in those days," Ogan remembers. "The berks who sit on top of the plinths'd climb down to listen to Trolan sing and play. 'Course, they drank plenty of ale and wine on those nights, and even the Dark Hunter was known to come by now and then to hear Trolan perform. Trolan was going to make me rich, and I was going to let him. Then that stupid cleric showed up and ruined everything!
>
> "You never tell an impressionable young sod like Trolan about something wondrous he can't ever have. It was a recipe for disaster! Now look what's going on. Trolan comes back and the locals've built him a temple!
>
> "The Lady of Pain! I'm from Sigil, and let me tell you, not ever a barmy would try to worship her! You'd have to be suicidal.
>
> "Say, can I get you cutters some drinks? The star petal wine is particularly tasty this time of day...."

At the inn, the PCs meet a seemingly friendly cleric who insists on helping them in their quest. However, the berk's really **Pastor Browen** (Pl/♂ human/P12/—/CE), a barmy from Harbinger House sent by Nari to delay the PCs and hinder their progress. Having learned that Trolan's been trapped in the gate-town of Curst for a few days, Browen approaches the PCs to pass on the news. The barmy hopes the PCs'll go there and get stuck as well.

> A man wearing spiky armor covered with odd protrusions walks over, carrying a full pitcher of ale. "Fill your mugs, bloods?" the man asks. You notice he has a huge mace slung at his belt and the symbol of the Xaositects pinned to his breast.

Browen acts like an addle-coved Xaositect, but he never reveals his darker side, mentions the Mad God he worships, or tries to preach to the PCs at this time. Instead, he engages them in friendly conversation, waits for an appropriate opening, then lets them know what he's heard. "The barmy who's been singing about Sigil's high-up? I heard he's in Curst, preaching to the citizens and organizing a pilgrimage to the Cage." After he drops the bait, Pastor Browen downs his drink and wanders out of the inn.

**DM Note:** More information about Browen — including his full game statistics — appears on page 45, near the section where the PCs are most likely to fight the barmy. Browen's not going to attack the group in Ecstasy; he plans to ambush them in Curst.

### 5. The Temple of the Beloved One

After Trolan recruited a few of the locals and left Ecstasy to preach in other towns, a young man named **Jakoly** (Pr/♂ human/P3/Believers of the Source/NG) found great truth in Trolan's words. Jakoly believes that Trolan's more than a prophet — he thinks the tiefling is a power. With the help of other berks who heard Trolan speak, Jakoly renovated an abandoned temple and set up a new religion in the City of Plinths.

While the new religion hasn't caught on like wildfire, it has gathered a handful of devoted followers. Among these devotees are a few lawful types who were passing through Ecstasy when the words of Trolan (as presented by Jakoly) made them see the light. Since the murders began, though, a lot more people have flocked to the temple's open doors. Jakoly's preaching has touched those who are frightened by recent events, and the young man is feeding those fears to bolster the new religion.

> "The Dark Hunter can't help you," Jakoly preaches. "Neither can the Sun Master nor the Philosopher King. But the Beloved will protect you. As he walks without harm at the Lady of Pain's side, so too will you walk without fearing the blade of the murderer that seeks to cut you."

Some members of the temple can tell the PCs that Trolan was going to visit other gate-towns before heading back to Sigil. "By now he should be all the way to Curst," one of the devoted mentions.

### Sougad's Attack

Sougad knows Trolan from the time they both spent in Harbinger House. As the murderer carves a bloody path through Ecstasy, he learns about the Temple of the Beloved One, a place that causes great rage to flare within his soul. "How dare they worship that charlatan!" Sougad fumes. "I am the next power, not that fool who loves the Lady!"

After the PCs have had some time to explore Ecstasy and learn of Sougad's activities, Lawshredder decides to find his tenth victim among the sods gathered at Trolan's temple — after he sets the place on fire! The PCs might track Sougad to the temple, or Sougad can spring into action while the PCs are talking with Jakoly and his flock. However it occurs, when the PCs and Sougad are both in the temple, read:

> Across the large, open hall, near the pillars that flank the walls, the berk you've come to know as Sougad Lawshredder explodes from the shadows, shouting as he swings his sword at the worshipers gathered there. "You will bow down to chaos and murder!" he screams. "You will worship me!"

The hall is 150 feet wide, and the PCs start at the opposite side from where Sougad appears. Thus, the barmy gets one round to act before the PCs can retaliate. Sougad selects his target — a lawful berk with 37 hp and AC 10 — before leaping out of the shadows, and he hits the sod twice during the round for 18 total points of damage.

The DM should then roll initiative for the second round of combat. Sougad plans to continue slashing his target until the berk dies and 10 cuts have been delivered. As the target is a defenseless, robed cultist, Sougad shouldn't miss often, but the DM should still roll to see if the barmy hits (in case the target ducks, struggles, etc.). Once the victim has been killed, Sougad can deliver all remaining slashes needed for the ritual in a single round.

As the second round progresses, the crowd of worshipers and curiosity-seekers begins to run in panic. On initiative 5, any PCs who haven't acted yet notice that flames are raging around the second-floor balcony of the temple (Sougad set the fire a few minutes before he appeared). The PCs must decide whether to fight the fire, help the crowd escape safely, battle Sougad, or perform some combination of these actions. Read:

> Fire! Flames dance along the second floor of the temple, painting the entire balcony in crimson heat and thick smoke. Members of the crowd notice the fire, too, and full-scale panic erupts around you.

Sougad's placed the spell components for this murder next to a pillar, so he refuses to move too far from it. He must kill his victim within the prescribed range of 10 feet. If the PCs manage to save the first target, a similar berk foolishly rushes close enough for Sougad to attack. If that victim is saved, too, Sougad targets a lawful PC as his prey.

Each round that the battle rages, the fire gets an initiative roll as well. On its initiative, the flames spread, causing 1d12 points of damage to the upper floor of the temple. After 30 points of damage, the fire spreads to the lower floor, as flaming beams and other debris begin to fall. After 60 points of damage (or in the round after Sougad kills his victim), the temple becomes an inferno and the section near Sougad collapses, apparently crushing the murderer beneath stone, wood, and raging fire.

However, as soon as Sougad finishes his victim (thus completing this step in the ritual), he gains another innate ability: the use of a teleport without error power, once per day. When he delivers the last slash to his victim, Sougad draws in energy: A glowing, red aura emerges from the victim, slides up Sougad's sword, and enters his body. (The PCs can see this occur.) With teleport without error, Sougad disappears from the temple just as the balcony falls around him. The DM should describe the scene in such a manner as to make the group think Sougad's been killed.

Any PCs who were fighting Sougad at the time must make successful Dexterity checks at -2 to leap out of the way. Those who fail take 3d12 points of damage and are trapped beneath the burning rubble. Each round they remain trapped, the characters take an additional 1d6 points of heat and fire damage.

**The Real Chant:** When Sougad teleported away from the temple, he appeared near the garden gate that leads back to Sigil (Artemor Far, sleeping off some particularly potent ale, missed the barmy). While the PCs deal with Trolan and Pastor Browen in Curst, Sougad is heading back to Harbinger House, where he plans to commit the final three murders required to make him a power.

**Slipping the Blinds:** Since Sougad's target is an easy mark, the barmy should be able to slay him before the building collapses. However, if the dice show that the temple's taken 60 points of fire damage and Sougad still hasn't killed his tenth victim, the DM should keep the structure standing until the victim's dead. 'Course, it's possible to have parts of the building fall around the PCs — possibly making it easier for Sougad to kill his victim — or simply creak, groan, and threaten to collapse at any moment.

## Curst, the Walled City

The PCs work their way from Ecstasy to Curst by finding a portal or path that quickly gets them to the new gate-town. Unlike the situation in Ecstasy, the PCs don't have to explore and talk to a lot of NPCs in order to get to the crux of the scene. Instead, they find Trolan and his followers in short order. The trick then becomes finding a way back out of the Walled City while dealing with the trouble stirred up by Pastor Browen.

### A Quick Look

Curst sits on the philosophical shores of the plane of Carceri. For more information on the gate-town, refer to the PLANESCAPE Campaign Setting boxed set or *A Player's Primer to the Outlands*.

Dusty streets and bleak architecture reveal the nature of this burg. Most of the inhabitants of Curst are exiles from somewhere else, and bitter revenge is the driving force that keeps everything here going. Everyone dreams of vengeance — against those who wronged them, peeled them, or betrayed their love or confidence. They plan great schemes and even raise armies, but few can escape the binds that hold Curst's residents in.

Nearly circular in shape and surrounded by a high, razorvine-covered wall, Curst is built around a gate to Carceri. Five ring roads ripple out from the center of the city, forming six distinct districts. Bashers called the **Wall Watch** patrol the perimeter of the city. They let almost any berk into Curst, but very few are allowed to leave. Outsiders believe that the residents are prisoners in their own burg, but the residents see it as a way to keep the rest of the multiverse out. It's all a matter of perspective — one that changes mighty quickly once a body steps through the gate into the Walled City.

The wall and the razorvine keep folks in, of course, but the guards of the Wall Watch do their share, too. They require proof that a body has somewhere to go and a way to get there before they'll open the gate. Beyond these physical restrictions, two other factors — bitterness and fear — form the chains of this prison. Release your bitterness and overcome your fear and maybe — just maybe — the razorvine will let you pass.

### The Road

Whatever mode of travel the PCs decide to use (or the DM provides), they wind up on a dark and dusty road not far from Curst. A few dead bodies lie among the thorns of the razorvine growing beside the road, adding to the bleakness of the terrain. Behind the bodies, the razorvine grows so high that it blocks the view of anything beyond.

As the PCs near the great outer wall of the town, one of the dead bodies speaks to them. Read:

> "Berks! Hey, berks! Don't do it! It's a trap!" calls a voice from the razorvine to the side of the road. You notice a body dangling in the vines, pierced by thorns in a hundred places. The body's partly decomposed, with patches of white bone showing through gaping holes in the decayed flesh. It's the body of a human male, wearing the tattered remains of leather armor and traveling clothes. Suddenly, its head turns completely around, gazing upon you with dead, withered eyes.
>
> "Don't you know the dark of it? I didn't, which explains the mess I'm in now," says the dead man, his flat, dry voice emerging like dust from a freshly opened grave. "Here's the chant: Curst won't let you out unless you've got someplace to be. Make sure you have someplace to go, or you'll have to stay. That's my advice — you can take it or pike it for all I care!"
>
> With that, the body sags and becomes still, a dry husk of bones and dead flesh.

Any PC who tries to examine the body must make a successful Dexterity check with a -2 penalty to avoid the thorns. A failed check indicates that the PC takes 2d3 points of damage from the razorvine. If any PC manages to get close to the body, he finds all that remains of worth is a belt pouch and its contents: five gold pieces, two platinum pieces, and a small wooden triangle inscribed with the icon of a metal cage (a gate key to Sigil).

**The Real Chant:** Why did the body animate for the PCs? Berk, things happen in the multiverse that nobody can explain. The corpse's chant is important, however. It warns the PCs about Curst and gives them part of the solution to foiling the trap.

### Arrival

The dusty approach to the Walled City is notably empty. The stillness is broken by the sounds of the PCs' footfalls and the occasional cry of an unseen bird. An unadorned wall circles the town, its exterior lacking even a hint of the razorvine that covers the interior. The road leads to a large gate that opens as the PCs get close. Read:

> The gate swings open, revealing two bashers with large pikes waiting to greet you. "Welcome to Curst," one of the bashers sneers. "Enjoy your stay," the other adds in a monotone voice. He waves you through with his gloved hand, not even bothering to ask your business or charge a fee, as so many other walled towns do.

If the PCs enter, the bashers ignore them and quickly seal the gate. If the PCs ask questions, the bashers become impatient. "Are you coming in or what?" one asks. "We don't got all day, and we can't keep these open too long. So stop rattling our bone-box and make a decision." Once in town, the PCs notice that the inside of the wall looks much more formidable than the outside. Thick razorvine crawls up the wall, making it impossible to get closer than two feet to the actual fortification. A wide, circular road runs along the inside of the wall. Across it, stables, taverns, and inns form a ring of structures leading up to the next circular road.

### The Trap

Pastor Browen arrived in Curst shortly before the PCs and has been hard at work ever since. The barmy told **Sergeant Qarz** — one of the officers of the Wall Watch — that a group of cutters would be arriving soon, a band who'd caused all kinds of trouble in Sigil and some of the other gate-towns. Browen said they're coming to Curst to stir up the Anarchists and disturb the peace. "Besides," he told Qarz, "the help you provide will make my power very happy. That means you'll get the reward you've always dreamed of. Just make sure the cutters don't leave for at least 24 hours."

Sergeant Qarz agreed, convinced that the reward would be a ticket out of Curst and back to the home he barely remembers. With the dozen or so bashers of the Watch loyal to him, Qarz plans to detain the PCs for at least one full day.

Meanwhile, Pastor Browen met with a prominent member of the local Anarchists. **Xero Baox** (Pl/♂ tiefling/F12/Revolutionary League/CE), a berk who hates authority and loves revolution, was very receptive to Browen's chant. "The tiefling named Trolan has a lot of followers," Browen noted. "When his cutters arrive, they're going to take over this burg and put all of us free-thinkers in the dead-book." That's all it took. Now Baox is ready to smash Trolan's cult before it gains any more momentum.

### Saving Trolan

Once inside the town's wall, it doesn't take the PCs long to find Trolan. A crowd of sods dressed in silver and amber robes mulls around a tavern marked by the sign of a skeletal steed with a horn protruding from its skull — **The Undead Unicorn**. Trolan is in the tavern, depressed and anxious to find a way out of Curst. Although Trolan and his followers don't realize it, Trolan is in grave danger. Xero Baox has a special arrow of slaying and is on his way to use it when the PCs arrive in Curst.

As the PCs work their way toward The Undead Unicorn, so do Baox and four Anarchist bashers. If any PCs make successful Wisdom checks, they notice the suspicious group entering the tavern. Baox and his gang wear ill-fitting robes of silver and amber, their folds barely concealing the armor, swords, bow, and quiver they're carrying. The Anarchists are obviously not the gentle cultists they're posing as.

The PCs must hurry. They reach the door of the tavern just before Baox nocks the arrow. On the first round of combat, Baox puts the arrow in place on his initiative while his bashers throw off their robes and prepare to defend him. The next round, he fires the arrow unless the PCs stop him (he's standing about 30 feet from Trolan, on the opposite side of the common room). If the arrow hits Trolan, it automatically kills him, but this should only occur if the PCs really mess up. Even if they can't stop Baox from taking aim and firing, one of Trolan's followers can leap in front of the arrow before it hits its mark. (If the arrow hits another target, it acts as an arrow +3.)

Baox plans to destroy Trolan no matter what. He attacks the tiefling with everything he has, and he directs similar attacks against those who stand in his way. The PCs have to kill or otherwise incapacitate Baox to stop his fanatic offensive. Once Baox and his bashers are defeated, the PCs can talk to Trolan.

**DM Note:** Baox won't betray Pastor Browen, no matter what methods the PCs use to question the Anarchist. However, Baox does parrot the reasoning Browen "helped" him arrive at — that Trolan's cult must be stopped before it spells doom for free-thinking bodies everywhere.

> **Xero Baox** (Pl/♂ tiefling/F12/Revolutionary League/CE): THAC0 9; #AT 3/2; Dmg 1d8+2 (long sword +2); AC 3 (plate mail); hp 67; MV 12; SA arrow of slaying for bards; SZ M (6 feet tall); Int very (12); ML fearless (19); XP 3,000.

> **Anarchists (4)** (Pl/var/var/F7/Revolutionary League/CN): THAC0 14; #AT 3/2; Dmg 1d6 (short sword); AC 6 (scale mail); hp 36 each; MV 12; SZ M (5 feet tall); Int average (10); ML fanatic (17); XP 420.

### If Trolan Dies

In Chapter III, Trolan takes part in the exploration of Harbinger House and tries to bring the Lady of Pain into the final battle. However, his role is not critical; if the PCs fail to stop Xero Baox, the DM shouldn't feel absolutely compelled to figure out a way to keep Trolan alive.

'Course, Trolan's absence in Chapter III will have a few ramifications. The PCs'll be denied the tips he can provide on the barmies of the House, as well as the chance to receive his healing touch. In addition, they'll lose the experience points they would have gained from saving his life. Finally, without Trolan, the PCs'll have a much harder time convincing Kedd and the rest of the cultists to abandon their deadly plan to honor the Lady of Pain.

### If Trolan Survives

At some point, the PCs stand face-to-face with Trolan the Beloved. When this occurs, read:

> The man before you stands just a bit over five feet tall, with a thin form and obvious grace. His face shines with the glow of the plane-touched. Tapered ears, eyes of pure blue with a red-rimmed radiance, and the slightest growth of horns on his high forehead mark him for what he is — a tiefling, a child of the planes. Long reddish-blond hair frames his handsome face, and his beautiful smile draws both men and women to his side. He wears the same amber and silver robes as his followers. When he looks at you, you feel as though you would do almost anything he asked.
>
> "Have you come to hear my songs, good friends?" he asks. "Shall I tell you about the Lady, or have you come to join us on our pilgrimage to the heart of the Cage?"

Trolan radiates trust and friendship. No one within 10 feet of the tiefling can harm him unless they first make a successful saving throw vs. spell with a -4 penalty to shrug off the effects of the field of fellowship that surrounds him. Trolan doesn't even have to use his innate abilities to influence a crowd. His natural presence and charisma, as well as his bardic talents, make him almost irresistible.

He starts to tell the PCs all about the Lady of Pain and why she deserves their love and devotion unless they steer the conversation in another direction. They won't be able to talk him out of his infatuation, and he never gets angry, so arguing is pointless. If they approach him as a friend, the PCs can convince Trolan to accompany them to Sigil — that's where he plans to go, anyway.

During this meeting, the PCs learn that a large group of cultists is already on its way to Sigil. "My friend **Kedd** leads them," Trolan explains. "I wanted to speak to the citizens of this town before returning to Sigil myself. Kedd knows a route through the Court of Light that should get them there in another two days. I have to be back by then, too. That's what the Lady told me. If only the Wall Watch would let us leave!"

If a PC asks why Trolan has involved so many people in his infatuation with the Lady of Pain, the tiefling provides an answer:

> "After years of hoping and wishing, the Lady finally came to me," Trolan explains. "She appeared to me at Harbinger House, and she spoke the words I longed to hear. She said she loved me, but I had to prove my love to her. To do this, she said I had to tell others how I felt and send them to Sigil to share my love with the Lady. I can still hear her beautiful voice in my head."

**The Real Chant:** As far as anyone knows, the Lady of Pain has never spoken. It was Nari, disguised as the Lady, who appeared before Trolan at Harbinger House. However, if the PCs try to convince Trolan that the being that spoke to him — whatever it was — was *not* the real Lady, the tiefling simply smiles, shakes his head, and states that soon the PCs, too, will believe.

**DM Note:** In two days' time, Kedd and the cultists — with or without Trolan — will arrive at Bloodgem Park in Sigil and conduct their ceremony to the Lady of Pain. The PCs have that long to get out of Curst, return to the Cage, and find out what's happening in Harbinger House. Otherwise, the cultists will die, slashed by the shadow of the Lady. While such a catastrophe won't stop the PCs from defeating Nari and Sougad and restoring Harbinger House to the Godsmen, it does deny them experience points for saving the cultists.

### Escape from Curst

The second part of Pastor Browen's trap is sprung the moment the PCs try to leave Curst. The only conventional way out of town is through the Wall Watch-defended entry gate. (The only known planar gate within the town leads to Carceri, and even if the PCs could find and activate it, that plane is even harder to escape from than Curst.) If the PCs try to fly or climb over the wall, the razorvine simply grows to match their progress. The town won't let its charges out so easily.

When the PCs approach the entry gate, Sergeant Qarz and his bashers are on duty. The Wall Watch asks the usual questions ("Where do you think you're going? Do you know how to get there? Do you have the means?"), listens impatiently to the answers, and refuses to let the PCs pass. "The gate's closed till tomorrow," Sergeant Qarz says. "Come back after lunch and maybe we'll open it then."

If the PCs don't have a key for a gate back to Sigil, or if they don't even know where to find such a gate, none of this matters. The Wall Watch won't let them out unless they have somewhere else to be and a way to get there. Even if they can prove that Curst can't hold them, the PCs have to deal with the corrupt sergeant and his loyal bashers. Battle is the obvious solution, but other methods for foiling this part of the trap include:

- Getting **Yurel Zarnthaskar** (Pr/♂ human/F10/Fated/LN), the commander of the Wall Watch, to assist them. The PCs can accomplish this in a number of ways. Threats that Trolan's continued presence'll bring a visit from the Lady of Pain scare Zarnthaskar into letting the group out. Promises to lend future aid to Zarnthaskar — who's itching to return to his prime-material homeworld and seek revenge against his enemies — also win his assistance.

- Turning Baox and the Revolutionary League against Qarz and his bashers, possibly by inciting them to rise up against the "evil" guards who'd try to keep "noble, free-thinking cutters" imprisoned against their will. However, Baox and his group won't fight unless the PCs battle at their side.

- Disguising themselves and pretending to be some other group of cutters when they try to leave — cutters who can prove they've got somewhere to go and a means of getting there. The DM must decide if the PCs' "proof" is enough to convince the Wall Watch to open the gate.

**Sgt. Qarz** (Pl/♂ human/F10/Transcendent Order/CN):
THAC0 11; #AT 3/2; Dmg 1d10+2 (halberd +2); AC 5 (chain mail); hp 54; MV 12; SA Strength bonus (+1 to attack and damage rolls); SZ M (6 feet tall); Int high (14); ML champion (16); XP 2,000.

**Wall Watch Bashers (14)** (Pl/var var/F4/var var):
THAC0 17; #AT 1; Dmg 1d10 (halberd); AC 5 (chain mail); hp 23 each; MV 12; SZ M (6 feet tall); Int average (8); ML elite (13); XP 120.

## Browen's Last Stand

Pastor Browen surreptitiously watches the PCs as they try to escape from Curst. If it seems like they're going to get past the Wall Watch, Browen emerges from his hiding place and attacks with full fury, intending to kill as many PCs as he can. The time for subtlety is past. His mission is to delay the adventurers in Curst as long as possible, and he figures that forever would be a good length of time.

As he attacks, the barmy — in his rage — inadvertently reveals more about his mission than he'd planned. Fact is, his rantings are clues to the PCs that something darker is behind the attack:

> "No! You'll not return yet! She's not ready! Those cultists must die! She needs the blood! The blood! Open the doors! Open all the doors!"

Browen becomes more and more incoherent as he continues to yell. The PCs might misinterpret his ravings to mean that the mysterious "she" literally needs the blood of the cultists, missing the point that the poor sods are just a distraction to cloak her true activities.

If the PCs bind and question Browen, he reveals a good deal more about Nari, screaming that he must return to the House to help her take it into the Abyss. However, he knows nothing about Nari's bid to become a power.

**DM Note:** Pastor Browen worships an unnamed god of evil who he refers to as "the Mad One." The barmy priest believes that the best way to convert a sod is to bash his head in; if the sod dies, Browen's power gets a new spirit to use in the cause of insanity.

The **Godsmen** marked Browen as a power-in-the-making due to his innate abilities to exercise limited control over the local weather. Without using arcane words, magical gestures, or strange components, Browen can call forth a wall of fog, direct a gust of wind, or summon an ice storm (as per the spells of the same names). He uses these abilities as his own madness moves him, but always with great showmanship and a sermon of insanity.

**Pastor Browen** (Pl/♂ human/P12/—/CE):
THAC0 14; #AT 1; Dmg 2d4+3 (morning star +3); AC 2 (field plate); hp 53; MV 12; SA cleric spells (8 1st-level, 7 2nd-level, 6 3rd-level, 4 4th-level, 2 5th-level, 2 6th-level); MR 20%; SZ M (6 feet tall); ML fanatic (17); XP 9,000.
Str 12, Dex 8, Con 10, Int 12, Wis 18, Cha 8.
Spell-like abilities (usable at will): gust of wind (three times per day), ice storm (two times per day), and wall of fog (three times per day).

## Back to the Cage

Once free of Curst, the PCs can follow the road back to Ecstasy and take the gate in the garden back to Sigil. If they didn't take the gate key (the wooden triangle) from the dead body in the razorvine outside of Curst, the DM can have a friendly sod in Ecstasy provide them with a key — that is, when he gets around to it. Remember, folks in Ecstasy don't like to rush.

The DM can also provide the PCs with a gate on the Outlands a bit closer to Curst.

# Chapter III: Harbinger House

With **Trolan the Beloved** (or Mad, depending on a body's perspective) in hand, the PCs return to Sigil and search out the mysterious place called **Harbinger House**. They have a limited amount of time before the cultists led by Kedd arrive, so they have to be quick about finding whoever or whatever is behind the deception played on poor Trolan. For his part, Trolan firmly believes that the Lady of Pain spoke to him. He won't tell his followers to stay away unless the PCs can prove that someone has tricked him. To do that, the PCs have to find **Nari** the succubus.

The PCs must explore a portion of the House and deal with a number of its special inhabitants before finally confronting Nari and learning the details of her twofold plot. First, she wants to convince the residents of Harbinger House that chaotic evil is the best belief system for their hearts and souls, thereby causing the House to slip into the Abyss. On that plane, Nari can study its secrets at her leisure. Indeed, the PCs find chaotic evil tendencies in many of the barmies in the House.

The second part of Nari's plot centers around her version of Sougad's murderous ritual. With a specially prepared long sword, the succubus plans to slay 13 lawful sods in the presence of the planarity and the focrux, thus — she hopes — transforming her into a power. But when the PCs reach Nari, the situation grows more complicated with the arrival of Crimjak and a number of manes from the Abyss. What's more, **Sougad Lawshredder** himself returns, ready at last to make his own bid for powerhood.

**The Real Chant:** Harbinger House won't actually slide over; Sigil is immune to such manipulations. Nor can Nari become a power by copying Sougad's ritual; only true powers-to-be like Sougad and Trolan can be transformed. However, Nari doesn't know either of these things and plans on seeing each goal through to the end.

The PCs should believe that Sougad died in Chapter II; however, the barmy made it back to Sigil and went directly to Harbinger House. By the time the PCs reach the House, Sougad's already killed two more lawful sods within. Clues scattered throughout may alert the PCs to Sougad's presence, but they won't run into him until the final scene.

**DM Note:** The map of Harbinger House, printed on the DM's side of the gatefold screen, depicts only a small portion of this immense mansion. The true scope of a place that's larger on the inside than it is on the outside can't be adequately detailed in the course of this adventure. However, the DM should feel free to add more rooms as desired to expand the PCs' exploration of the House.

## Returning to Sigil

Whoever the PCs agreed to help at the start of Chapter II comes looking for them the moment they step through the portal back to Sigil. If they decided to go after Trolan on their own (or followed Sougad to the Outlands and then got involved with the cult), Narcovi tracks them down. She still has questions, and as long as the dabus continue to act strangely, she'll keep digging. It's her belief that the dabus' behavior is somehow connected to the murders, so in her mind the case won't be solved until the dabus return to normal.

Other possibilities: Kariana wants to know if they've found her brother Kedd; **Factol Ambar** wants to know if they've found Trolan and Sougad; and other faction leaders want to know what's been happening on the Outlands and when they can expect more cultists to arrive.

If the PCs can't locate Harbinger House on their own, they can ask Factol Ambar for directions; he'll be at the Great Foundry, the headquarters of the Godsmen. Ambar thanks the PCs for returning Trolan and asks them to take the barmy back to the House.

> "Custodian Bereth will be happy to see Trolan," Ambar admits casually. "She'll be very helpful when you get there. Afterward, return here and we'll see to your reward."

Ambar also seems disturbed that he still hasn't recovered the missing planarity (stolen for Nari in Chapter I). If the PCs question him about it, the factol divulges a bit more about the item than he had in the past, confessing that the planarity opens portals and records images of surrounding events for later historical study. He asks the PCs to keep an eye out for it when they return Trolan to the House.

**Slipping the Blinds:** If Trolan was killed in Curst, Factol Ambar simply hires the PCs to locate the missing planarity, suggesting that its magical energies are so closely tied to Harbinger House that the House is the best place to begin the search. (No factol in the history of the Godsmen has ever lost the planarity. To prevent the theft from being made public and weakening his position as factol, Ambar must employ "outside" cutters — the PCs — to do the leg work.)

If the PCs seem reluctant to visit Harbinger House at all, the DM can have several dabus — acting more strangely than ever — follow them around the streets of the Cage. The dabus communicate their tension and fear by forming picture-symbols of the area around the House, which should encourage even the most hesitant PCs to check the location out.

## First View of the House

The trip through Sigil's streets to Harbinger House reveals that the dabus continue to display uncharacteristic behavior. They're still cleaning "dirt" from spotless cobblestones, painting freshly painted walls, and trimming razorvine to the very roots. The closer the group gets to Harbinger House, the more dabus they see hard at work. During the trip, one dabus turns to gaze upon the PCs and Trolan. Read:

> A nearby dabus lowers his paintbrush and turns in your direction. He stares at you, his mouth open, as though he were about to speak, but no sound emerges. A symbol appears above his head, however, hovering where you can easily see it: the fiendish symbol, pierced by a downward arrow. A moment later the symbol fades and the dabus goes back to what he was doing, once again ignoring you and your companions.

The symbol is the icon of the Abyss. The dabus, and perhaps through him the Lady of Pain, is providing a warning to the PCs as to the nature of the true enemy. In a way, this is also a call for help, as the dabus haven't been able to trace their nervousness to its source (due to the scrying shield generated by the focrux).

When the PCs reach the dead-end street where Harbinger House resides, they immediately notice something odd: There are no dabus working on the street. In fact, there's almost no one around. The nearby hovels appear tightly locked or deserted. No street beggars or merchants are evident. Compared to the hustle and bustle on the surrounding streets, the deathly silence and stillness of this street should be particularly jarring to the PCs. Read:

> The street you were directed to is set off from the rest of Sigil by a spiky wall of stone and razorvine. Once you pass through the gate formed by the arching walls, you notice an immediate difference from the other streets you walked down. There aren't any people here, or dabus, or shouting merchants, or arguing faction members. It's quiet, deserted, and terribly dark. Shadows fill every corner. The walls and the leaning hovels block much of Sigil's dim light. It's hard to imagine that a huge mansion sits among these decrepit structures. Then you see it, and everything you imagined is swept away.
>
> Harbinger House fills the end of the street, climbing above the high walls that surround three sides of its massive structure. It's a place of insanity, for no clear-headed architect designed this jumble of towers, levels, and wings. Its oddly tilted walls, weirdly slanted roofs, and uneven windows make it almost painful to look at. There are doors, arches, and staircases everywhere, covering surfaces that should instead be covered by shingles or tiles or paint.
>
> As your eyes roam across its door-covered walls or try to follow a staircase that winds to nowhere, you notice a remarkable thing. The House was built without using a single right angle. Instead, every corner forms an acute or obtuse angle, making walls jut toward you or tilt away from you at varying degrees.
>
> All is quiet. Even the windows are dark, but you sense that someone (or something) is staring down at you. Then the door at the top of the porch swings open, beckoning you inside.

If the PCs view the opening door as a trap, they might try to search out a different entrance. All the other doors and windows are locked, however, and won't open for brawny bashers or even knock spells. Fact is, the focrux causes the House to reflect spells, effectively barring bloods from teleporting, phasing, or otherwise gaining magical access to the place.

The only way in is through the front door.

## What About Trolan?

Trolan travels with the PCs as they explore the House, accompanying them either because he followed them from Curst or because the PCs brought him there at Factol Ambar's request. However, unless the danger is extremely grave, Trolan won't raise his sword against the House's residents. With the exception of Sougad, he considers them all to be his friends.

Trolan can, of course, give the PCs information about some of the residents. He knows nothing about Galkin, Kaydi, or Teela, but if the PCs need help with any of the other barmies, Trolan can pass along a hint or two. However, he doesn't know where the doors lead, as he was never allowed to wander on his own.

By the time the group enters the House, Trolan's natural healing ability has restored him to his maximum hit points. He can also heal some of the PCs' wounds by taking them into Area 4A, where the focrux used to be kept (see page 50 for details).

**Slipping the Blinds:** If Trolan was killed in Curst, the PCs must navigate their way through the House without the tiefling's advice or healing touch.

## Exploring the House

Nari's been cooking up a welcome for the PCs ever since she spotted them in Bloodgem Park. She knew they'd eventually track her to Harbinger House, and it doesn't take long for word to reach her of their return to Sigil. With the stolen planarity, Nari's gained control of a portion of the House and the barmies residing therein. Between the barmies and the doors she's left open, she believes the PCs'll be kept busy — if not killed outright — until she becomes a power or the House slides into the Abyss.

**The Doors:** All the doors indicated as locked on the map on the gatefold screen can't be opened by any means except the planarity. But even if the PCs find the planarity, they can't use it to open any doors in the House. Neither Factol Ambar nor Nari will divulge the command word needed to use the item.

As indicated on the map, some of the doors open directly onto other planes. If any PCs open such a door, the DM can have them pulled onto those planes, or allow them to teeter on the brink before being pulled back into the House by quick companions.

**The Windows:** A number of windows in Harbinger House are actually portals that lead to — and look out upon — other planes. Whereas normal portals never show their destination, the magic of Harbinger House allows a body to look through one of the windows and see where he'll end up. However, taking a side trip could result in the PCs arriving too late to stop Nari or Sougad. Trolan should urge

the PCs not to get too close to the windows, as they probably don't have keys for returning. If the PCs insist on using the windows, the DM can do as he pleases — let them explore, drive them back to the House before the portal closes, or even send them on a completely different adventure.

**The Residents:** The more prominent barmies of the House have names and full statistics, as detailed throughout this chapter. Nari's given some of them magical items so they have a better chance to delay and perhaps even kill the PCs.

However, the House also contains various other beings, including Godsman caretakers who've been charmed or imprisoned by Nari, less powerful barmies, and dretches brought from the Abyss to guard Nari and her plans. If the PCs battle any of these other residents, the DM may use the following statistics or invent specific details for each, as desired:

**Average Barmy** (Pl/var var/F2/—/var):
THAC0 19; #AT 1; Dmg 1d3 (fists) or by weapon; AC 10; hp 9; MV 12; SZ M (5 feet tall); Int very (12); ML average (10); XP 35.

**Godsman** (Pl/var var/0/Believers of the Source/var):
THAC0 20; #AT 1; Dmg 1d3 (fists) or by weapon; AC 10; hp 7; MV 12; SZ M (6 feet tall); Int high (14); ML steady (12); XP 35.

**Dretch:**
THAC0 19; #AT 3; Dmg 1d4/1d4/1d4+1; AC 4; HD 2; hp 12; MV 3; SZ S (3 feet tall); Int low (6); AL CE; ML steady (12); XP 1,400.
Spell-like abilities (usable at will, once per round, unless otherwise indicated): darkness 15' radius, infravision, scare, stinking cloud (once per day), telekinesis, and teleport without error.

## The Rooms of Harbinger House

### 1. The Porch

A series of wooden steps lead up to a slightly elevated, open-air porch. This is the main entrance used by the Godsmen who care for the House and its inhabitants, and the only one currently available to the PCs. Two wooden pillars hold up the roof, and large bay windows frame each side of the plain front door.

### 2. The Entrance Hall

The front door leads into a large entrance hall. A thick rug decorated with the icon of the Believers of the Source covers the floor, and various couches and chairs are set comfortably around the room. Two massive fireplaces cover much of the far wall, cheery fires burning brightly in each. A single door in each wall leads deeper into the House.

When the PCs enter this room, read:

> At first glance there's no one to greet you, but then you hear the squeak of a rocking chair. A rocker by the fireplace on the right teeters at a rapid pace, its back toward you to hide its occupant.

If the PCs approach the rocker, they can see who's sitting there. Read:

> A young man sits in the rocker, wrapped tightly in a thick blanket and shivering though the nearby fire blazes hotly. He stares blankly into the flames, mouthing words in a whisper almost too low to hear. If you strain, you can pick up his chant, which he repeats over and over again. "Chaos dance and chaos burn, the Abyss is that for which I yearn."

This is one of the Godsmen (Pl/♂ human/0/Believers of the Source/LN) who helped care for Harbinger House, as the badge he wears on his tunic indicates (though it's currently hidden by the blanket). Nari has broken the faction members, turning them into even bigger barmies than the addle-coves they used to administer to. Those whose minds collapsed have been given easy chants to sing until the House slides over to the Abyss. If they can't actually join Nari, at least they'll pay lip service to the doctrine of her home plane.

### 3. Godsmen Cells

The Godsmen who work at Harbinger House use these small cells as living quarters. Each one contains a bed, a small table, a chair, and a storage chest. Various belongings are still packed away, including spare clothes, weapons (a short sword and dagger in each chest), and a small amount of jink (10d4 cp each). None of the items are magical, though there is ample evidence that the people who occupy these rooms belong to the Believers of the Source (faction symbols are sewn into or otherwise adorn everything).

Two cells hold things of interest to the PCs. The cell marked "3A" on the map contains a dead body, the eleventh victim of Sougad. The poor sod was a male Godsman, his face twisted into a terrified grimace and his body covered by 11 deep slashes made by a large blade. There's a parchment note, three nutshells, and a discarded vrock feather here as well.

The cell marked "3B" is the only one currently occupied by a living body. A matronly female (Pl/♀ elf/0/Believers of the Source/CG) lies curled in a ball atop the bed. Her mind has been shattered by Nari's attempts to win her over, and now only the barest hint of the woman she was remains. She doesn't respond to anything the PCs say or do; she just lies there with her eyes closed tight and her thumb in her mouth. It'll take a lot of time and effort to help this woman return to normal — something the PCs can't afford at the moment.

### 4. Custodian's Corner

**Bereth**, the newest custodian to serve at Harbinger House, uses the larger room as an office and the smaller room beyond the door as her living quarters. Windows in the office provide a view of the street outside Harbinger House.

The office contains a large desk, a couch, a number of chairs, and a bookcase full of scrolls and books (though many of the texts now cover the floor). This area is a mess. The desk has been overturned and emptied. The items on the shelves have been tossed about. Someone was obviously looking for something, but there's no way to tell if it was found or not.

If the PCs spend time looking through the mess, they can find a few clues that might help them. One is the custodian's journal. The beginning of the journal features entries made by **Old Favur**, the custodian before Bereth. His entries end about four weeks ago, though quite a number of pages have been torn out after that. The very last page written by Favur talks about a young woman he met at The Ascension:

> "Nari's a beautiful woman with dark hair and laughing eyes. She makes me feel almost as young as she is! We talked for hours, and she promised to meet me tomorrow night for dinner."

Favur's portion of the journal ends there.

The journal picks up after the ripped-out pages with the first entries made by Bereth. There are a week's worth of these, dealing with normal House business. But one entry, dated three days ago, may intrigue the PCs. It reads:

> "I'm still bothered by the bad omen that greeted my first day here at the House. Two of those in our care escaped, including one we've learned to fear over the years — Sougad Lawshredder. I'm afraid that the murders now taking place throughout the Lower Ward and The Lady's Ward are his doing. I also believe that the recent arrival of berks claiming to love the Lady of Pain can be traced to the other escapee — Trolan of Ecstasy. I won't be able to rest easily until both of them are returned to these walls.
>
> "Of course, this might not be the safest place for them. It could be my imagination, but I have the feeling that something's wrong here. A few of the residents have mentioned a strange woman wandering the halls, and while I don't believe them, I can't help wondering where this shared delusion is coming from."

### 4A. Meditation Chamber

When the PCs enter the custodian's living quarters, Trolan locates and opens the secret door (marked on the map) and takes them through to a small, square, empty room.

> "This is where the focrux used to be," he says. "I always spent hours meditating in here, calmed by its soothing energies."

All Trolan can tell the PCs about the focrux is that the Godsmen called it "the heart of the House" and that it was said to prevent outsiders from looking inside. However, residual energies left in this chamber by the focrux bring Trolan's natural healing ability to the fore. If allowed a few moments to meditate, Trolan gains the power to deliver a healing touch to the PCs. The PCs who've been kind to Trolan up to this point in the adventure receive the equivalent of *cure serious wounds* — Trolan's touch restores 2d8+1 lost hit points. The PCs who've been neutral or nasty to Trolan receive the equivalent of *cure light wounds*, regaining 1d8 lost hit points.

The act of healing others tires Trolan; it only works while in the meditation chamber and only works once for each PC. Repeatedly leaving and re-entering the chamber will not grant Trolan additional healing power.

**Slipping the Blinds:** If Trolan isn't with the PCs when they enter the custodian's living quarters (for example, if he was killed in Curst), they can't gain any healing benefits from the meditation chamber. They may still find the secret door, but only Trolan can gain the power to heal by meditating within.

### 5. Storage

This long, narrow storage room contains blankets and extra bedding, table cloths, nondescript clothing, and boxes full of wooden bowls. These are for the residents being cared for in the House. Windows high on the far wall are sealed up with stout boards. If the PCs remove the boards, they find that the windows look out not on Sigil but on the Elemental Plane of Water.

A secret panel on the wall behind the blankets (which can be found if the PCs successfully search for a secret door) hides a small alcove. The alcove contains two potions of healing, one potion of extra healing, an elixir of health, and an elixir of madness. The elixir of health can be used to cure one of the barmies in the House, or any PC who drinks the elixir of madness. However, it does not heal wounds or restore lost hit points. Any barmy cured with the elixir loses his innate powers.

### 6. Godsmen's Kitchen

This kitchen provides meals for the faction members who live in the House while caring for the resident barmies. Windows in this room have been boarded up, though the boards have been removed from the window on the left side of the door. Light from Krigala, the first layer of the Beastlands, spills into the kitchen through the uncovered window. If the PCs look out, a lion wanders over and looks in.

A wide variety of ingredients cover the great table here, and all five huge kettles are boiling over with some strange-smelling dishes. Two Godsmen, one male and one female, scramble from pot to pot, adding a touch of this or a dash of that, stirring the boiling mixtures, or just taking satisfied whiffs of the contents.

These Godsmen have been driven to insanity by Nari's seductive urgings. She's made them chaotic evil through her subtle manipulations, which becomes evident if the PCs linger in the kitchen. Read:

> The man wears a loincloth and an apron as he moves from steaming pot to boiling kettle, tossing ingredients into each pot from a basket he carries. There doesn't seem to be a pattern to his recipe, and his ingredients don't look very appetizing — a handful of worms, a pinch of insect shells, a dash of sharp glass. "For the celebration," he whispers when he sees you. "We're moving today and Nari wants to have a party!"
>
> The woman wears a sack that's been altered to serve as a long tunic, gathered at her waist with a length of razorvine. Her knee-high leather boots are spattered with dark, wet stains, and she wears a necklace with the Godsmen's icon as a bandanna around her head. She dances from pot to pot, sniffing the aromas.
>
> "Have you come for dinner?" she asks. "Or maybe you are dinner. I think you're just what we need for this dish." With that, she pulls a long dagger from behind her back and smiles wickedly.

These barmies aren't responsible for their actions. They were both respectable Godsmen before Nari began working her charms on them. The PCs' best bet is to leave the room. The barmies won't follow the PCs, as they must stay with their chaotic stews. If the PCs linger in the kitchen, both Godsmen attempt to add them to the stews.

### 7. Godsmen's Dining Hall

This large chamber is the Godsmen's dining hall. All of the Godsmen working in Harbinger House take their daily meals here. Two massive fireplaces cover most of the side walls, and four large round tables are set in the center of the room. A number of comfortable chairs sit facing the fireplace on the left side of the hall.

**Aztral of the Many Faces** has been given this room to defend by Nari, the new mistress of the House. Originally, he had a neutral outlook on the multiverse; thanks to Nari, that's now shifted to chaotic evil.

Aztral is schizophrenic, and like all of the barmies in Harbinger House, he has a few unique abilities that mark him as a power-in-the-making. Among these abilities is the power to change personalities and alignments as often as a Xaositect changes his mind. This talent revolves around his affliction. Aztral mimics the personalities of those around him, shifting to their way of speaking, walking, and thinking, and even gaining the best of their talents through magical absorption. Since the change wrought by Nari, Aztral's personality becomes a chaotic evil version of the character he emulates. To the PC, it's like looking into a twisted mirror and seeing his or her own dark reflection.

The targets of Aztral's absorption get a saving throw vs. petrification. A successful throw indicates that Aztral was unable to absorb the target's abilities; a failed throw means that the barmy succeeded.

Once Aztral absorbs a PC's personality and talents, he gains that character's natural properties — hit points, physical attributes, combat skills, and any special abilities (such as memorized spells). Whatever weapon Aztral fights with — currently, a large, wooden spoon — behaves just like the absorbed character's weapon, including damage amounts and enchantment bonuses. Aztral can hold on to a character's talents for 1d6 rounds. At the end of that period, he must absorb someone else's talents or revert to his own statistics.

When the PCs enter this room, Aztral picks the most powerful-looking one to absorb first. Read:

> A lone figure sits in a large, comfortable-looking chair in this dining hall. He's a human male with short-cropped black hair, silver eyes, and a plain white tunic over black pants. He waves a long wooden spoon and smiles at you. "Welcome to the domain of Aztral," he exclaims, leaping from his chair. "These chairs, those tables, the fireplaces! Everything you see is mine!"
>
> He steps toward you, and for a moment his whole body turns silvery, like the surface of a mirror. You see your own reflection in his silvery form, and then the effect is gone. "Well," Aztral says gleefully, "now that I'm you, there can only be one of me!" With that, he swings his wooden spoon at you, its glowing head suddenly looking very dangerous.

During the encounter, Aztral keeps asking the PCs if any of them have a lawful outlook on life. "Are you lawful? You look like a lawful sod. You should head right up to the party. There's a place at Nari's table for lawful sods like you." He doesn't provide any further information about the party or Nari.

**Aztral of the Many Faces** (Pl/♂ human/F4/—/CE):
THAC0 17; #AT 1; Dmg 1d2 (wooden spoon); AC 6 (Dex bonus); hp 26; MV 12; SA innate ability (absorption); MR 25%; SZ M (6 feet tall); ML champion (15); XP 1,400.
Str 11, Dex 18, Con 13, Int 14, Wis 8, Cha 11.

### 8. Hall of Doors

This long, narrow hall contains many doors. While there's only one door on the wall the PCs enter through, the other walls are covered with them. There are a total of eight doors at ground level; the walls extend 50 feet to the ceiling, and every 10 feet up is another row of doors. If the PCs have some way of reaching the higher doors, they find that all of them are locked. Only the eight doors at ground level can be opened.

Each ground-level door has a letter assigned to it on the map on the gatefold screen. These doors lead to the corresponding letter shown elsewhere on the map. For example, if the PCs open the door marked "D," they find themselves looking out onto the Ethereal Plane.

If any of the PCs make a successful Wisdom check at -2, they notice a small creature wriggling on the floor between doors "E" and "F" — an Abyssal leech. Sougad dropped it from the pouch on his belt as he was heading toward Nari's chamber.

### 9. The Endless Stairs

The door marked "B" leads to a spiral staircase that descends and ascends as far as the PCs can see. If they climb in either direction, the stairs just keep going. The PCs can wander forever on these stairs, and that's just what Nari hopes will happen. The door can't be seen from the inside, as it blends into the wall and becomes a secret portal. To find it again, the PCs have to search for it. This takes time (10 minutes for every 10-foot section of stairs) and requires a successful roll for finding secret doors. The DM must decide how far from the door the PCs wander before they try to exit back into the hall.

### 10. Tower of Windows

The door marked "I" opens into a tower room. A free-standing spiral staircase in the middle of the room climbs to a height of 30 feet and stops just beneath the ceiling. It doesn't lead to another level; it just stands alone in the center of the room.

Windows of varying widths cover the walls, stretching from the floor to the ceiling. Each window looks into a different prime-material world in the multiverse. One shows the crowded streets of Waterdeep, another looks out upon the sandy wastes of Athas, a third displays the majestic towers of a castle in Karameikos, and so on. Some show portions of Krynn, Greyhawk, an island chain where dragons rule over elves and dwarves, and other places so strange that the PCs barely recognize what they're seeing.

These windows aren't portals; the PCs can't step through one and wind up, for example, in Waterdeep. They're just reflections of what the barmy who resides in this tower sees all the time. **Galkin Farseer** sees all of the varied worlds of the multiverse at once, and the views have driven him mad. He sees these images wherever he looks, even when he closes his eyes. Sleep doesn't provide a respite, as the images follow him into his dreams. The windows, however, help separate the images and focus his thoughts. He's learned to transfer a single image to a single window, thus clearing away some of the jumble that's always with him.

When the PCs arrive, they don't notice Galkin at first. He's sitting on the stairs, about halfway up, staring at the images of Waterdeep scrolling behind one of the windows. Galkin hates to be disturbed, and the constant barrage of landscapes and societies that assault his senses give him a very bad temper. He also has a few powers available to make his temper dangerous. Galkin is what the Godsmen call "spell-touched." He embodies the living essence of one particular spell: *lightning bolt*. This doesn't give him the ability to cast a bolt from his fingertips; he actually becomes the bolt of lightning, cascading around the room and causing damage to whoever he touches.

Galkin can become a lightning bolt at will, but he must make a successful Constitution check to actually transform. His energy form lasts for one action in a particular round and gives him all the attributes of a *lightning bolt* spell. In other words, he has a range of 100 yards, he causes 6d6 damage to all in line of the bolt (victims can save vs. spell for half damage), and he can travel from one point to another instantaneously. If he tries to transform and fails, he can't try again for 1d4 rounds. In the rounds when he can't transform, Galkin uses his short sword of quickness to automatically attack first.

Before they can speak with him, the PCs must calm Galkin down by helping him regain the concentration they disturbed by entering the room. Focusing his attention on one of the windows helps, as do soothing discussion and kind words. Shattering the windows makes Galkin go crazy, as the images he transferred to it come rushing back. This makes him more angry, and he redoubles his efforts to make the PCs leave.

If the PCs do calm Galkin down, he tells them what little he knows about Nari.

> "She's not what she appears to be," Galkin explains. "She wants to take the House into the Abyss — to use its secrets in the Blood War."

**DM Note:** If the PCs open any of the windows in this room, they simply find themselves looking out of one of the House's towers, high above Sigil's streets.

**Galkin Farseer** (Pl/♂ human/F10/Bleak Cabal/CN):
THAC0 11; #AT 3/2; Dmg 1d6+2 (short sword of quickness +2); AC 8 (Dex bonus); hp 64; MV 12; SA Strength bonus (+1 to damage rolls), innate ability (becomes a lightning bolt at will on a successful Constitution check; causes 6d6 points of damage per attack and moves at the speed of light); MR 10%; SZ M (5 feet tall); ML fanatic (18); XP 5,000.
Str 16, Dex 16, Con 14, Int 15, Wis 10, Cha 12.

### 11-18. The Twins

The twins **Vorina** and **Teela** reside in this wing of the House. These barmies see all things as they truly are, but in significantly different ways. Vorina sees everything as vital and alive, observing the growth of new flesh as it replaces old, the flowering of hair as it grows longer, and the energy of life that radiates from all living things. Consequently, she's happy and upbeat. Teela, on the other hand, sees everything as dying and decaying. She can see the life force ebbing with each heartbeat, the body wearing out with each passing moment. This makes Teela very moody and dark.

The twins have other powers that go along with these perceptions. Vorina can heal and nurture the life forces around her; Teela can quicken the pace of death's eternal march. Vorina will help the PCs if they need it, for she doesn't share Nari's point of view. Her sister Teela, however, has embraced Nari's ideals, giving herself over completely to chaotic evil.

### 11. Vorina's Den

This room contains a comfortable stuffed chair, a bookshelf full of cheerful books, a large potted plant that thrives in the corner, and a window looking out upon the restful plane of Elysium.

### 12. Vorina's Kitchen

This small kitchen has a cooking fire, a fine collection of pots and pans, a table and chair with a beautiful place setting, and a larder full of good food. Vorina cooks and eats her meals here most of the time. She used to venture out to the main dining hall twice a week or so to visit with the other residents, but she has given up this practice since Nari took over the House.

The mirror hanging here reflects the best view of those who gaze into it. It amplifies the viewer's life force, making him appear more vibrant and alive than he may actually feel at the time. Fact is, if a viewer stares into the mirror for a full 10 minutes, he feels refreshed; the experience restores 1d4 lost hit points (up to the viewer's normal maximum).

### 13. Vorina's Bath

A beautiful bathtub with running water occupies much of this room. A fluffy rug, fluffy towels, and a variety of soft sponges and fragrant bath soaps complete the decor. Potted plants hang from the ceiling, giving the place a feeling of life and vitality.

When the PCs enter this room, Vorina is soaking in her tub and appears quite surprised to have visitors.

> "Was I expecting you?" she asks, rising slightly from the soapy water.

Vorina has bright blond hair, blue eyes, and tanned, healthy skin. If the PCs have been injured, Vorina uses her healing powers to help them. She won't leave her part of the wing, won't oppose her sister (though she will warn the PCs to avoid the other end of the wing), and only discusses Nari in the most general way. She's afraid that if she makes too much of a deal of opposing the succubus, she'll have to face Nari's wrath.

> "Many of the residents have disappeared," Vorina explains. "I don't want to join them."

**Vorina** (Pl/♀ human/P9/Society of Sensation/CG):
THAC0 16; #AT 1; Dmg 1d3 (fists); AC 8 (Dex bonus); hp 38; MV 12; SA cleric spells (4 1st-level, 4 2nd-level, 3 3rd-level, 2 4th-level, 1 5th-level), innate abilities (*create food and water* [three times per day], *heal* [two times per day], *plant growth* [three times per day], *purify food and drink* [three times per day]); MR 30%; SZ M (6 feet tall); ML steady (12); XP 3,000.
Str 9, Dex 16, Con 18, Int 12, Wis 16, Cha 17.

### 14. Vorina's Bedchamber

Here, Vorina's soft, comfortable bed is piled high with blankets and silky sheets. Ruffles and veils hang from the bed posts, giving the bed a very feminine appearance. Dressers, a closet, a fireplace, and a shaggy rug make up the rest of the furnishings in this cozy chamber. The window looks out upon the stacked layers of Bytopia.

### 15. Teela's Den

The window here looks out upon the Negative Energy Plane. The skeleton of a dire wolf is mounted to a base on the floor, and a bare wooden chair sits facing the window. A bookshelf contains books of a depressing nature, including tomes on necromancy and burial techniques.

### 16. Teela's Kitchen

Like a nightmare version of Vorina's kitchen, this area is a dark reflection of the worst sights and smells of cooking.

Rancid, rotting meat is spread across the black tabletop. Stained and crusted utensils are everywhere. A pot of foul stew bubbles over a cheerless fire, its top caked with a brown, unidentifiable crust.

A mirror in this room reflects images the way that Teela sees them. Bodies look pale and sickly or even skeletal and rotting, depending on how old or close to death a particular viewer is. Just gazing at one's reflection in this mirror requires a save vs. death magic. Failure indicates that the viewer can't turn away for 1d4 rounds and has become grimly fascinated with his own mortality. At the end of that time, the character must make another save to pull away or be caught by the view for another 1d4 rounds. Each round that a character is forced to look into the mirror, the dark glass draws his life energy; the character loses 1d4 hit points every round as his life force slips away.

Teela's in the kitchen when the PCs arrive. She's preparing a special dish for Nari to celebrate the slide into the Abyss. If she realizes that the PCs have come to stop Nari, Teela uses her powers to try to destroy them. Her fascination with death is a mania, and she has a morbid curiosity about what those who are dying are feeling. She asks many questions as she slowly drains the life out of the PCs.

Teela won't say much about Nari, except to remark that opposing her is fruitless.

> "Every new power needs worshipers," Teela says. "Bow down before Nari or die."

Str 11, Dex 12, Con 8, Int 17, Wis 12, Cha 9.

### 17. Teela's Bath

A sunken tub fills much of the tile-covered floor in this chamber. The entire place looks like a swamp, as molds and slimes grow across the tiles, over the walls and ceiling, and atop the foul, stagnant water. If the PCs poke around in here, they encounter Teela's pets — a gray ooze and a brown mold.

**Gray Ooze (1):**
THAC0 17; #AT 1; Dmg 2d8; AC 8; HD 3+3; hp 19; MV 1; SA corrodes metal (chain mail in one round, plate mail in two, magical armor in one round per each plus to AC); SD immune to spells (except lightning bolt) and fire- and cold-based attacks; SZ L (10 feet); Int animal (1); AL N; ML average (10); XP 270.

### 18. Teela's Bedchamber

This place looks more like a mortuary than a bedchamber. A fireplace stands in the corner. Six skulls hang from the mantle, reflecting the firelight from their bone-white surfaces. Instead of a soft bed, a large stone slab occupies a portion of the room. Cobwebs hang like curtains throughout the area, and the smell of freshly turned dirt permeates the stale air. The window in this chamber looks out upon a cemetery on the Gray Waste, where the PCs can see ghouls and other low-level undead wandering about.

### 19. Hall of Statues

This wide hall features odd statues of monstrous beasts. One's a weird version of a medusa, complete with three snake-covered heads and a lizard's tail. Another has the body of an owlbear and the head of a mind flayer. One is a beholder with the body of a stone giant, while another is a winged wolf with six legs instead of four. Windows on each end of the hall look out upon the caves of Pandemonium, and the constant wind rattles the panes of glass.

### 20. Statue Forest

This large chamber features a well-tended miniature forest, complete with trees, bushes, and a carpet of grass. The ceiling, about 20 feet off the floor, has skylights built into it that let in the light of Arborea's sun. Several statues stand among the trees, though none have bases and all look amazingly lifelike. This is the domain of the barmy named **Gorg Redeyes**, a bariaur with the ability to turn living creatures to stone.

Gorg considers himself an artist, waiting until a subject strikes just the right pose before using his gaze ability to turn the subject to stone. However, the bariaur is also troubled by the guilt such an act creates within him. He agonizes over what he's done for days in a state of manic depression before sliding over into extreme happiness at what he's created.

When the PCs arrive, Gorg approaches them in manic glee and tries to turn as many of them as he can into stone. After two of the PCs have been transformed, his mood swings in the other direction and he becomes severely depressed. He screams at the PCs, shouting one minute for them to leave and the next to be punished for what he's done. Convinced that Nari's already a power, Gorg speaks of her with great reverence and devotion.

**DM Note:** Area 27 contains two *stone to flesh* scrolls, which can be used to restore any PCs who succumb to Gorg's gaze attack.

Str 14, Dex 12, Con 13, Int 13, Wis 10, Cha 16.

### 21. The Rock Garden

Pathways of colorful stone wind through this garden room. Flowers of all descriptions grow in neat little rows among the paths, and skylights in the ceiling provide sunlight from the Arcadian sky.

This is the chamber of **Tomin**, a tall, wiry, and cruel barmy with long, greasy hair. He wears what appears to be a black cloak but is actually a cloak of figments. Figments are tiny, humanoid shadow creatures — literally, figments of Tomin's imagination made real by the powers of his addle-coved mind. They hang together from Tomin's back and arms, forming a cloaklike cape of moving, chattering beings.

Tomin commands his figments, often sending them scurrying away from his body to take any shape he can imagine. If a PC fails to make a successful save vs. rod when attacked by a figment, the PC believes it to be real, and the figment can then cause real damage. Each PC must make his own saving throw; if even one PC fails the roll, the figment becomes real for all. If attacked by several figments, the PCs must save against each one separately.

Tomin's figments come in three types: small, medium, and large. Small figments appear as pixies with shark heads, or goblins with tentacles for arms. Medium-sized figments take the form of wolf-headed humans, winged beetles the size of elves with tooth-filled maws all along their abdomens, or centaurs with the heads and torsos of tieflings attached to the bodies of red dragons. Large figments look like cyclopses with tentacles instead of legs, or huge snakemen with scimitar arms and dagger teeth.

If Trolan is present, Tomin laughs hysterically.

> "The Lady can't see you here," he cackles. "She can't see any of us! That's why Nari's going to win! I love her!"

**Tomin** (Pl/♂ human/F7/Believers of the Source/CE):

### 22. Corridor of Doors

When the PCs step through one of the portals that leads to this corridor of doors, they see Nari in the form of a beautiful, young, human female. She stands near the locked door farthest from their entry point. Read:

> You step into a long corridor with doors all along the wall you entered by, but only a single door on the wall across from you. There's also a person here: A young woman with long, dark hair, a slinky, dark dress, and the most beautiful figure you've ever seen stands at one of the doors a few feet away from you. She smiles at you, and you notice that she has a strange object in her right hand. Actually, it floats just above her open palm. It's a small globe with protrusions that constantly emerge and retract. The center of the globe is black, with swirling colors dancing within.

Nari tries to use her charm ability on one of the male PCs. If she succeeds, that character thinks about her for the rest of the adventure and turns against his companions in the final battle. Whether or not Nari succeeds in charming the PC, read:

> "You've been trying to ruin my plans for quite some time now," the young woman says in a voice that makes your pulse race. "You'll regret your actions, I promise you that. Soon this House will be mine, and then I'll find you all permanent places within it." With that, huge bat wings emerge from her back and she whispers a word you can't hear. The floating globe flashes and the door beside her swings open without a touch. She steps through, and the door slams shut before you can reach it.

The door Nari stepped through locks behind her. Only the planarity can open the door. Nothing else — neither physical force nor magic — can unlock it. The PCs must choose one of the other doors to exit this corridor.

Beyond the door on the opposite wall, a staircase leads up to a landing just outside Area 23. The staircase continues up to another landing, ending at a closed door (marked "P" on the map).

**Slipping the Blinds:** If any PCs were charmed by Nari when she watched them in Bloodgem Park (at the start of Chapter II), those characters now feel friendly toward the succubus and protective of her. While they won't yet attack their companions, they may take action to prevent Nari from being harmed — tripping a PC who rushes to attack Nari, shoving a crossbow aside just as a PC fires, and so on.

### 23. Mind Trap

The door to this room opens into darkness. If the PCs provide a light source, they see a large, featureless chamber. An older woman lies face down on the floor right inside the door, while a teenaged girl lies curled up asleep in the center of the room. After all of the PCs have entered the room, the door closes and disappears. They've entered the domain of **Kaydi**, a teenaged human female who's been in a catatonic state almost constantly since her eighth birthday. Her claim to the state of power-in-the-making is that her catatonia extends to the physical world around her, affecting those within its area of influence.

The blankness of her own mind projects to the very edges of the room. The furniture that actually fills the room exists in another space, while the emptiness of Kaydi's mind has become the reality here. The older woman is Bereth, the House's custodian. Nari had Bereth placed here to keep the custodian from disturbing her evil plans.

Just being near Kaydi puts all of the PCs into a relaxed, sleepy state. Every round within the area of Kaydi's influence (a 15-foot radius), the PCs must make saves vs. paralyzation to fight off stupor. On successful saves, characters lose only one point of Constitution. Failed rolls indicate more substantial losses; how many points are lost depends on how close to Kaydi the PCs are. Within a five-foot circle directly around the girl, a PC who fails a save loses 1d8 points of Constitution. Five to 10 feet distant, the PC loses 1d6 points. At the farthest range of her influence, 10 to 15 feet, the loss is only 1d4 points. When a PC's Constitution score is reduced to 0, that character collapses into a deep, sleeplike, catatonic state. Before the stupor claims all of the PCs, those still awake must figure out how to defeat this mind trap. If they all fall asleep, they wake up bound and gagged in Nari's ritual chamber (Area 33), where they're to be killed as part of her bid for powerhood (the DM should turn to page 60 and proceed with the conclusion of the adventure).

Searching the boundaries of the room reveals no openings, but the walls don't feel completely solid either. It's like touching flesh more than wood or stone. The walls can't be cut or shattered, and magical attacks simply bounce harmlessly away. If a PC tries to wake Bereth, he probably fails — only a *remove paralysis* spell can awaken her. Even then, it only brings her around for a few seconds, but that might be long enough for her to give the PCs a solution to this trap. She tells them they must wake Kaydi, which they can do by simply shaking the girl.

If Kaydi is awakened, the blankness shimmers and fades, revealing an ornate bedroom. Kaydi lies in a bed, resting comfortably among plush pillows and thick blankets. Any PCs who fell into a stupor also wake up. Kaydi apologizes for any harm she may have caused and tells the PCs to hurry and leave before she falls asleep again. However, 2 rounds later, she goes back to sleep, the blankness returns, and any newly awakened PCs collapse again.

The group must escape while Kaydi's still awake, as that's the only time when the door is visible. Three PCs moving on their own or one PC carrying another can exit each round through the door. Sleeping characters must leave the area of Kaydi's stupor effect before they can awaken and begin to regain lost Constitution points (which return at a rate of one point per round). If the PCs decide to take Kaydi with them, the stupor field continues to affect them.

If the PCs rescue Bereth, she won't be able to help them. She explains that she has no special combat skills or abilities; she's only an administrator. However, she agrees to find an exit and bring help back to the House. If the PCs insist she remain with them, she becomes a target for every attack they run across. If they let her leave, Sougad grabs her to use in the ceremony he's planned for the final scene.

**Slipping the Blinds:** If the PCs decide that the solution to this trap is to kill Kaydi, they have to deal with the consequences of such an action. Of all the powers-to-be in Harbinger House, Kaydi is the closest to making the ascension. If the PCs kill her, they release her life force to become a power before it's fully ready. This results in a weaker power, but a power nonetheless — and a power very hurt and angry with the PCs.

Kaydi becomes a demipower of sleep with the following spell-like abilities: *deep sleep* (functions as a normal *sleep* spell but affects 4d4 Hit Dice of creatures) and *dream storm* (inflicts 1d8+1 points of damage and target must save vs. paralyzation or fall unconscious for 1d4 rounds). Before she departs both Harbinger House and Sigil, she uses her *dream storm* ability to knock unconscious as many PCs as possible. When the affected PCs awake, they're troubled by unusual nightmares for the next 1d6 months — the nightmares experienced by a power created before its time. The bad dreams cause them to feel frightened and insecure even when awake. (The DM may allow the PCs to later find Kaydi and perform some service for her in order to end the nightmares and ease their troubled minds.)

**The Real Chant:** If Kaydi does become a power, the focrux protects her from the Lady of Pain's notice. A property of Sigil itself, however, affects powers who somehow wind up in the city. They feel pain that starts as a dull ache but builds to intolerable levels within 1d4 hours, at which time they must leave the Cage to escape the pain.

**Kaydi** (Pl/♀ human/0/—/NG):
THAC0 20; #AT 1; Dmg by weapon; AC 10; hp 6; MV 12; SA innate ability (stupor field); MR 15%; SZ M (5 feet tall); ML average (9); XP 65.
Str 7, Dex 8, Con 8, Int 11, Wis 9, Cha 13.

### 24. Common Hall

This hall, with its soft chairs and low tables, serves as a common room where the barmies get together to socialize under the supervision of the Godsmen caretakers.

A barmy (Pl/♂ gnome/0/Believers of the Source/LN) hides rather badly behind a wall hanging. He's scared witless, but if the PCs approach him in a nonthreatening manner, he tells them what he's hiding from.

> "The pretty woman with bat wings is taking all the lawfuls. She's going to kill them and drink their blood! But she won't get me! She won't!"

### 25. Laundry

This long room with its basin of running water is where the Godsmen caretakers wash the clothes and bedding used by the barmies residing in the House. Colored dyes have been added to the water, and sheets and clothing hanging from lines around the room have been washed in the rainbow water. Now they look like chaotic flags, much in keeping with Nari's world view.

The other significant feature of this room is the dead body floating in the water — a female Godsman, Sougad's twelfth victim. Her face has the now-familiar cast of fear, and she was killed by 12 slashes of a large blade. In addition to the usual parchment note, he used her blood to scrawl a message across one of the rainbow-stained sheets. It reads: "Chaos is the only power, purified in the blood of law."

### 26. Barmy Dining Hall

The addle-coves who reside in the House (and aren't normally confined to their rooms) take their meals here. Currently, a dozen barmies are engaged in a winner-take-all food fight, spurred on by a pair of pathetic dretches. The PCs can try to break up the chaotic conflict or simply move on. If they enter the room, they become targets for whatever culinary delight is at hand. Most of the food doesn't cause any damage when it hits a target, though some heavy bowls could inflict as much as 1d2 points of damage if they hit.

**DM Note:** There's a 10% chance that any particular bowl of food has been contaminated with a mild acid. If a PC is splattered with a bowl of acid-tinged food, he suffers 1d4 points of damage.

### 27. Barmy Kitchen

This kitchen is used by the Godsmen caretakers to prepare meals for the barmies under their care. Currently, one Godsman (Pl/♂ half-elf/0/Believers of the Source/LN) — charmed by Nari — and three dretches work to keep the food fight supplied with ammunition. Stopping the production of more meals will severely hamper the efforts of the food fight.

One of the dretches carries a barrel of mild acid, adding a small quantity to every tenth bowl or so. If the PCs try to disrupt the efforts of these cooks, the dretch attempts to splatter them with the acid. There's enough left for six splashes of acid; each splash causes 1d6+1 points of damage.

A locked cabinet in one corner of the room contains three scrolls. One features recipes that look particularly scrumptious. However, each of the other two contain one *stone to flesh* spell, which can be used to restore victims of Gorg Redeyes (see Area 20).

### 28. Hall of Mirrors

A barmy named **Chance** greets the PCs when they enter this room. He's a chaotic fellow by nature — paranoid, neurotic, plagued by indecision and fear — and he can't make any decisions without consulting the dice he always carries.

One wall of the room is lined with statues of previous factols of the Believers of the Source; the opposite wall is lined with mirrors. The mirrors distort whatever is reflected in them, paralleling the way Chance sees the world around him. One mirror reduces images, another makes images taller. One shows images as wider and thicker than they truly are, while another shows them thin and insubstantial. The mirror in the far corner is actually a secret door that leads to Chance's bedchamber. To use it, a character must simply step into the mirror.

Chance carries a pair of four-sided dice, and he tosses them whenever he needs to make a decision that will affect only himself (for example, "Should I take a bath?"). An odd roll makes him act to his own benefit, and an even roll makes him act against his better interests.

However, if Chance needs to make a decision that might affect someone else, he asks that person to call "odds or evens" before he rolls the dice. For example, Chance wants to kill the PCs to help Nari shift the House into the Abyss — a course of action that'll definitely affect others (namely, the PCs). When the PCs arrive, he picks one as his first target, asks that PC to choose between odds or evens,

and rolls the dice. If the number comes up in the PC's favor, he leaves that cutter alone (for the moment) and moves on to another. If the dice fall in his favor, Chance does his best to put the losing PC in the dead-book.

Chance has a few innate powers that help him. First, he's extremely lucky. All game-related die rolls made for Chance receive a +4 bonus, and all die rolls made against him suffer a -4 penalty. Second, he projects a field of bad luck that affects those within it (except himself). Every character within 15 feet of Chance must make a save vs. wand before acting every round. A failed save indicates that wherever something can possibly go wrong, it does. A PC slips and falls face-first to the floor, loses his grip on a weapon, pulls the wrong spell components from a pouch, etc. — something always happens to spoil the PC's action for that round.

If the battle goes badly for Chance, he dives through the mirror to hide in his secret room. If the PCs follow, they find him rolling his dice over and over, trying to decide what to do.

**Chance** (Pl/♂ human/T8/Fated/CE):
THAC0 17; #AT 1; Dmg 1d6+1 (short sword +1); AC 3 (studded leather, Dex bonus); hp 32; MV 12; SA backstab damage x3, innate abilities (extreme luck, field of bad luck); SD tumbling (AC reduced to -1 when this is the only action Chance takes in a round); MR 45%; SZ M (5 feet tall); ML elite (13); XP 3,000.
Str 15, Dex 18, Con 11, Int 14, Wis 8, Cha 15.

### 29. Chance's Chamber

Chance lives among all kinds of games of chance and decision-aiding devices. Card decks, dice, a gambling wheel, coins, divination sticks, rune stones, and similar objects fill table tops and shelves in this bedchamber. There are books on probability that appear more dense than the most convoluted theory of magic, parchment sheets with odds calculated to the last decimal, and all kinds of luck-inducing items from various cultures. Two of these items are actually magical (a lizard's claw and a bright blue feather) and work the same way as a *stone of good luck*. A jar on one table contains live Abyssal leeches, which Chance keeps on hand for Sougad Lawshredder. Alert PCs might notice it's half empty. There are also four potions of healing and two potions of extra healing hidden in a case beneath the bed.

If the PCs get Chance to trust and talk to them (he's very receptive to things that improve his odds, including gifts of lucky coins and such), he reveals that Sougad visited recently and took a few handfuls of leeches with him. However, he can't recall if it was an hour ago, a day ago, or a week ago. If the PCs press him about Sougad, Chance opens a hollow divination stick and pulls out a rolled-up scroll that was hidden inside.

> "I won this from him playing cards. He wasn't too happy about it — he's a real sore loser — but I won, yes I did. It's mine now."

The scroll details the steps of the ritual that Sougad and Nari hope will turn them into powers. Chance won't surrender the scroll, but the PCs can try to win it from him in a game of dice or give him a "lucky" item in exchange. By reading the scroll, the PCs can learn the steps of the ritual as presented in "The Dark of the Murders" (see page 17 in Chapter I).

If the PCs ask Chance about Nari, he admits that her plan can't work.

> "Nah, the House won't slip into the Abyss," he sneers. "The Lady won't let it. Course, if she don't know it's happening, what can she do? That's the thing about the focrux, it hides the House from the Lady."

If asked about the focrux, Chance says:

> "It's a big globe that changes shape and has stars inside it. Sougad says its energy can make him a power."

**DM Note:** If the PCs don't follow Chance immediately through the secret door in the mirror, he gets to imbibe one of the potions of extra healing. If they delay for more than three rounds, Chance drinks another potion (if he needs it).

### 30. The Last Hall

The PCs enter this hall through one of two unlocked doors on the long wall. There's a single door on the opposite wall. As soon as the first PC steps into the hall, a *magic mouth* on the floor to the far left says, "Halt! Turn back! No one may cross this room!" It then spits out a 13d6 fireball that rolls down the hall and explodes. PCs who successfully save vs. spell receive half damage. Each round that someone remains standing on the hallway floor, the magic mouth repeats its warning and spits another fireball at the PCs. A *dispel magic* cast at the mouth breaks the enchantment.

Windows at either end of the hall look out onto the Plain of Infinite Portals, the desolate first layer of the Abyss.

### 31. Dretch Room

Six dretches who work for Nari guard this room from intruders. In the dretches' minds, anyone but Nari and her cohorts is an intruder, so they attack the PCs when they enter.

### 32. Nari's Bedchamber

Nari has decorated this chamber to her liking, filling it with plush pillows, willowy silks, and candles of all descriptions. She's here when the PCs enter Area 33, donning her most fiendishly regal garb in preparation for the upcoming ceremony.

### 33. The Ritual Chamber

This cross-shaped chamber has been prepared for Nari's version of Sougad's ritual. She believes it'll not only elevate her to powerhood, but also push Harbinger House into the Abyss.

A pair of double doors is set into each wall. One pair provides the PCs with a way into the chamber; the locked doors will later provide an entry point for Sougad. The other two pairs of doors lead to Nari's bedchamber (Area 32) and to a corridor that opens into the Abyss. When the PCs enter this chamber, read:

> Arcane symbols have been inscribed on the walls, floor, and ceiling of this cross-shaped chamber. The symbols glow with a faint, evil light. In the center of the room, a large globe floats about 10 feet above the floor. The globe, almost 15 feet across, appears to be made of deep-blue stone, perfectly round and smooth. Thirteen sods, bound and gagged, are tied to stakes in a circle around the globe. Each sod has a different number of slashing wounds, and all appear to be alive — barely.

The symbols are all marks of chaos and evil, with quite a few representations of the icon of the Abyss (the infinity symbol pierced by a downward arrow). The globe is the **focrux**, a larger version of the planarity that Nari, Sougad, and the Godsmen believe is the heart of the House. It projects an aura that blocks the probing presence of the Lady of Pain and her agents; as long as it remains intact and operating, the Lady can't sense what Nari is trying to do.

The 13 sods are Nari's contribution to the ritual; she plans to kill them to become a power. While not all of the sods are identifiably lawful, a few wear either lawful holy symbols or the icon of the Godsmen. They also have parchment notes pinned to their shirts and a set of the appropriate spell components (either an iron rod and a bronze disc, three nutshells, or a crushed black pearl) tied to their belts. What's more, they've all been prepared with a number of shallow cuts so that each can now be killed with a single blade thrust. For example, the first sod, who must be killed with a single stroke, has been left unmarked. The thirteenth sod, however, has already received 12 slashes.

## The Final Battle

After the PCs have looked around the chamber but before they head to any of the other doors or try to free the captives, the doors leading to the Abyss swing open. Into the room strides **Crimjak**, the marquis cambion, along with three wretched manes per PC:

> The doors to the left swing open and crash against the wall. A whiff of noxious vapor emerges from the open doorway, rolling around the tall figure striding forth. The towering humanoid stands 7 feet tall, with pitch-black skin, pointed ears, and a wicked collection of spiked armor and weapons. A number of short, pale, bloated beasts crawl around his feet, snarling and slashing the air with their long claws.
>
> "You berks are definitely in the wrong place at the wrong time," the tall creature growls bitterly, hefting his ornate sword and moving toward you.

Crimjak wants to destroy the PCs or at least keep them busy while Nari completes her ritual, and he's brought enough manes from the Abyss to grab the group's attention. As soon as the fiends and the PCs start fighting, the commotion brings Nari, wearing her true form, out of her chamber. She hurries toward the focrux, a long sword in one hand and the planarity in the other. The planarity reacts to the larger globe and vice versa. Read:

> As the succubus approaches the floating globe, a storm of energy rises to the surface of the globe and begins to dance within it. Spiky protrusions emerge from the surface, jut as far as two feet from the globe, then plunge back into the stormy depths. The smaller globe floating just above the succubus's hand reacts in the same manner, mirroring the actions of the larger globe.
>
> Nari begins to sing a chaotic chant, and all the barmies throughout the House that she's charmed or otherwise convinced to join her begin to chant as well. The chaotic clamor reverberates in the very walls.
>
> "Slide," the succubus sings, "slide into the Abyss and leave this Cage behind!" You can feel the very walls vibrating with her song, as though the entire House were singing along with her. You tear your eyes away from the succubus for a moment to fend off the attacking fiends. When you look back, you see that she's killed the first captive with a single sword thrust and is lunging for the next one in line.

The PCs now have choices to make. Do they all fight the cambion and the manes, or do they split up to try to save the bound sods before Nari finishes killing them? Give the players a moment to make plans, but don't let them linger over complicated schemes for too long. Here's how the NPCs act during the first three rounds of this battle:

- Crimjak and the manes attack the PCs, trying to keep them too busy to interfere with Nari.
- In each round, Nari kills one bound sod.
- In the second round, Trolan rushes toward the focrux, shouting, "Lady, we need you! Save us!" He strikes the globe repeatedly with his sword, trying to smash it. Nari, fearing the destruction of the focrux, shapechanges into the Lady of Pain and, posing as the Lady, commands Trolan to stop. "I am here," she says. "Now, in the name of our love, I command you to begone!" The disguised succubus pushes Trolan away and, too stunned to react, the tiefling simply falls back and collapses to the floor.

- In the third round, Sougad emerges from behind the final set of doors. The surprise of his sudden appearance causes Nari to lose her concentration and resume her normal shape. Read:

> The far doors swing open with a crash, and Sougad Lawshredder enters the chamber. "You can't make the House move," Sougad mocks, sneering at the succubus, "but I can finish my ritual and join with it! When I offer the last lawlover to the House, I'll become a new power of murder and chaos!"

Sougad either has Bereth (if she was awakened and allowed to wander after the encounter with Kaydi) or plans on using one of the lawful sods staked around the focrux as his thirteenth and final victim.

**Slipping the Blinds:** If Trolan's absent from the battle, the DM should still have Nari polymorph into the Lady of Pain (so the planarity can record her transformation for later proof that the succubus tricked Trolan). One possible solution: The energy in the shapechanging planarity causes Nari to involuntarily change her own form; each round, she takes on a new appearance, one of which is the Lady of Pain.

**Manes (3 per PC):**
THAC0 20; #AT 3; Dmg 1d2/1d2/1d4 or by weapon; AC 8; HD 1; hp 6 each; MV 6; SA acidic vapor (when slain, manes becomes vapor that causes 1d6 points of damage to all those within 10 feet; save vs. poison to avoid); SD immune to mind-affecting spells, electricity, nonmagical fire, and poison; half damage from cold, magical fire, and gas; MR 10%; SZ S (3 feet tall); Int semi (2); AL CE; XP 975.
Spell-like abilities (usable at will once per round): darkness 15' radius, infravision, and teleport without error.

The DM should finish up the third round and let everyone make a new initiative roll. The NPCs each take the following actions on their initiative numbers, depending on the actions of the PCs:

**Nari:** If she acts before Sougad, she kills the next sod in line. If she acts after Sougad and is still alive, she calls to Crimjak for assistance.

**Sougad:** He attacks Nari to gain possession of the planarity. If the PCs try to stop him, he takes time out to battle them in the most expedient manner possible. He wants the planarity in hand when he kills the last victim, and he has no qualms about slaying Nari or the PCs to get it.

**Trolan:** Startled by Nari's transformation to the Lady of Pain and back again, Trolan stumbles about the chamber, his faith in his one great love shaken. He won't help fight any of the villains unless a persuasive PC convinces him that his aid is needed (the PC must make a successful Charisma check at a -6 penalty).

**Crimjak:** The cambion is in a battle frenzy and won't react to Sougad unless Nari calls him. He continues to fight the PCs until called or Nari falls, at which time he turns his attention to whoever threatened or hurt Nari.

**The Manes:** These witless tanar'ri simply attack the PCs until slain. A few manes may also attack Trolan, keeping him too busy to do anything but fight back.

## Power Play

If the PCs allow Sougad to strike Nari, the succubus takes a serious wound. Sougad grabs the planarity and moves toward the thirteenth victim to finish his ritual. If the PCs don't stop him, he kills the captive sod and quickly makes 12 more cuts in the body. This causes strange waves of energy to ripple from the dead sod to the focrux, from the focrux to the planarity, and from the planarity to Sougad. The energy grants Sougad another innate power — *chaos* (as per the 5th-level wizard spell, once per day) — and increases the enchantment of his sword to +3 (+5 vs. lawful opponents).

At this point, the PCs should realize that letting Sougad finish his ritual is a bad idea. The law slayer blade glows with cascading planar energy. If the barmy plunges the sword into himself, it'll open the conduit of spiritual energy necessary to elevate him to powerhood. However, Nari, no matter what else she may be doing, screams with rage when she sees the sword start to glow: "No!" she shouts. "I must become the power, not you!" She grabs at the sword, struggling with Sougad to possess it. Meanwhile, the planarity and the focrux continue to storm, sending explosions of color and strobing light throughout the chamber.

## Resolution

What happens next depends on what the PCs do — or don't do. The probable courses of action and their outcomes are described below.

### The Focrux is Destroyed

Having seen Trolan attempt to destroy the focrux, the PCs might try to do it themselves. However, the focrux can only be destroyed by magical weapons. To strike it, a PC must hit an Armor Class of 4. No damage rolls are necessary; instead, the globe makes saving throws to see if it's shattered by the blow. The base saving throw is 4, modified by the weapon's enchantment. For example, if a +2 weapon hits the focrux, the saving throw is modified by 2, increasing from 4 to 6. With each successful hit, the DM must roll the focrux's saving throw number or higher for the globe to remain intact. A failed roll indicates that the focrux shatters.

If the globe is destroyed, Harbinger House is no longer protected from scrying, and the Lady of Pain instantly becomes aware of the situation. Read:

> The large globe shatters in an explosion of sharp shards, bright colors, and cascading energy. A pillar of light fountains up from the spot and crashes through the roof, revealing the overcast sky of Sigil. A shadow moves across the opening, its corners sharp and cutting. It's the shadow of the Lady of Pain.

Everyone in the chamber takes 4d10 points of damage from the explosion and the flying shards (save vs. breath weapon for half damage). The slashing gaze of the Lady of Pain kills Nari and Sougad — those who dared grasp at powerhood — but never falls upon the PCs, Trolan, Crimjak, or the manes.

Once the deadly shadow passes, Crimjak's too scared to do anything but return to the safety of the Abyss. If the PCs let him, he flees through the appropriate set of double doors; if the PCs continue to attack, Crimjak fights with manic fury until he can escape through the doors. The DM can have the mindless manes either follow the cambion or remain in the chamber to fight until slain.

**Slipping the Blinds:** If either Sougad or Trolan becomes a power before the focrux is destroyed, the new power is not killed. Instead, when the Lady arrives, she casts the offending being out of Sigil, as powers are not allowed to walk the streets of the Cage. Nothing can be done to prevent this; in Sigil, the Lady's will is absolute.

### The Sword Slays Sougad

The PCs can prevent Sougad from completing his ritual by attacking the barmy or otherwise keeping him occupied. However, if Sougad is left alone for even one round, he plunges the glowing sword into himself, opening a spiritual conduit. Sougad's mortal body dies, and the focrux explodes, releasing planar energy into the chamber. This energy joins with the energy already collected in the sword, turning Sougad into a lesser power of chaos and murder.

The rest of the scene plays out as in "The Focrux is Destroyed," above.

### The Sword Slays Trolan

Trolan's not going to wrest the glowing sword from anyone's grip and plunge it into himself. However, PCs who realize what's going on might choose to do so (or try to convince Trolan that it's necessary to prevent Sougad's ascension). In any case, if Trolan is killed with the law slayer, he becomes a lesser power of peace and love. (The details of the event are the same as in "The Sword Slays Sougad," above — his body dies, the focrux explodes, and the Lady arrives to kill the cross-traders and cast the new power out.)

Before he leaves the Cage, Trolan uses his newfound abilities to smother the negative emotions and end the fighting; Crimjak and any surviving manes return peacefully to the Abyss. Trolan thanks the PCs for their aid and, with a sorrowful expression, departs Sigil. He knows the Lady won't tolerate his presence in her city, and he won't push the issue. Instead, he'll go in search of a plane where he can establish a realm and pine for the Lady in peace.

**DM Note:** Trolan's last act before leaving Sigil is to dissuade the cultists gathering in Bloodgem Park; see "Stopping the Cultists" on page 64.

### The Sword Slays Anyone Else

If Nari manages to get the glowing sword and use it on herself, all it does is kill her; she doesn't possess the required spark of divinity common to the spell-touched barmies of Harbinger House. The same thing happens if an ambitious PC plunges the sword into himself (or Crimjak, one of the bound sods, or even a manes). The energy stays locked within the blade, waiting for a power-to-be to release it. However, Sougad tries to get the sword back so he can use it on himself; if he's successful, events proceed as in "The Sword Slays Sougad," above.

### The Sword Slays No One

If the PCs defeat Sougad without destroying the focrux, they still must deal with Nari (if she's still alive), Crimjak, and the manes. Nari isn't really a major threat, especially once her plans are revealed to be futile. She can't become a power or get the House to slide into the Abyss. She tries to flee back to her home plane through the double doors, fighting to the death if necessary.

Crimjak, on the other hand, can be extremely dangerous, and he fights wickedly at Nari's side. However, if Nari's dead, he has no reason to stay and fight; if she flees, he likewise sees no point in sticking around. Without Nari, the cambion tries to return to the Abyss through the double doors leading to that plane.
